  Edge AI applications increasingly require ultra-low-power, low-latency inference. Neuromorphic computing based on event-driven spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an attractive path, but practical deployment on resource-constrained devices is limited by training difficulty, hardware-mapping overheads, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency. A case study on an autonomous-drone workload shows up to 312x energy savings relative to conventional deep neural networks while maintaining real-time operation.
