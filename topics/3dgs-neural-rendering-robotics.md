  We present UniScale, a unified, scale-aware multi-view 3D reconstruction framework for robotic applications that flexibly integrates geometric priors through a modular, semantically informed design. In vision-based robotic navigation, the accurate extraction of environmental structure from raw image sequences is critical for downstream tasks. UniScale addresses this challenge with a single feed-forward network that jointly estimates camera intrinsics and extrinsics, scale-invariant depth and point maps, and the metric scale of a scene from multi-view images, while optionally incorporating auxiliary geometric priors when available. By combining global contextual reasoning with camera-aware feature representations, UniScale is able to recover the metric-scale of the scene. In robotic settings where camera intrinsics are known, they can be easily incorporated to improve performance, with additional gains obtained when camera poses are also available. This co-design enables robust, metric-aware 3D reconstruction within a single unified model. Importantly, UniScale does not require training from scratch, and leverages world priors exhibited in pre-existing models without geometric encoding strategies, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained robotic teams. We evaluate UniScale on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and consistent performance across diverse environments. We will release our implementation upon acceptance.

  We present a scalable 3D reconstruction model that addresses a critical limitation in offline feed-forward methods: their computational and memory requirements grow quadratically w.r.t. the number of input images. Our approach is built on the key insight that this bottleneck stems from the varying-length Key-Value (KV) space representation of scene geometry, which we distill into a fixed-size Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via test-time training. VGG-T$^3$ (Visual Geometry Grounded Test Time Training) scales linearly w.r.t. the number of input views, similar to online models, and reconstructs a $1k$ image collection in just $54$ seconds, achieving a $11.6\times$ speed-up over baselines that rely on softmax attention. Since our method retains global scene aggregation capability, our point map reconstruction error outperforming other linear-time methods by large margins. Finally, we demonstrate visual localization capabilities of our model by querying the scene representation with unseen images.

  World models based on video generation demonstrate remarkable potential for simulating interactive environments but face persistent difficulties in two key areas: maintaining long-term content consistency when scenes are revisited and enabling precise camera control from user-provided inputs. Existing methods based on explicit 3D reconstruction often compromise flexibility in unbounded scenarios and fine-grained structures. Alternative methods rely directly on previously generated frames without establishing explicit spatial correspondence, thereby constraining controllability and consistency. To address these limitations, we present UCM, a novel framework that unifies long-term memory and precise camera control via a time-aware positional encoding warping mechanism. To reduce computational overhead, we design an efficient dual-stream diffusion transformer for high-fidelity generation. Moreover, we introduce a scalable data curation strategy utilizing point-cloud-based rendering to simulate scene revisiting, facilitating training on over 500K monocular videos. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that UCM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-term scene consistency, while also achieving precise camera controllability in high-fidelity video generation.
