  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently transformed the fields of novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction due to its ability to accurately model complex 3D scenes and its unprecedented rendering performance. However, a significant challenge persists: the absence of an efficient and photorealistic method for editing the appearance of the scene's content. In this paper we introduce VIRGi, a novel approach for rapidly editing the color of scenes modeled by 3DGS while preserving view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Key to our method are a novel architecture that separates color into diffuse and view-dependent components, and a multi-view training strategy that integrates image patches from multiple viewpoints. Improving over the conventional single-view batch training, our 3DGS representation provides more accurate reconstruction and serves as a solid representation for the recoloring task. For 3DGS recoloring, we then introduce a rapid scheme requiring only one manually edited image of the scene from the end-user. By fine-tuning the weights of a single MLP, alongside a module for single-shot segmentation of the editable area, the color edits are seamlessly propagated to the entire scene in just two seconds, facilitating real-time interaction and providing control over the strength of the view-dependent effects. An exhaustive validation on diverse datasets demonstrates significant quantitative and qualitative advancements over competitors based on Neural Radiance Fields representations.

  The D4D Dataset provides paired endoscopic video and high-quality structured-light geometry for evaluating 3D reconstruction of deforming abdominal soft tissue in realistic surgical conditions. Data were acquired from six porcine cadaver sessions using a da Vinci Xi stereo endoscope and a Zivid structured-light camera, registered via optical tracking and manually curated iterative alignment methods. Three sequence types - whole deformations, incremental deformations, and moved-camera clips - probe algorithm robustness to non-rigid motion, deformation magnitude, and out-of-view updates. Each clip provides rectified stereo images, per-frame instrument masks, stereo depth, start/end structured-light point clouds, curated camera poses and camera intrinsics. In postprocessing, ICP and semi-automatic registration techniques are used to register data, and instrument masks are created. The dataset enables quantitative geometric evaluation in both visible and occluded regions, alongside photometric view-synthesis baselines. Comprising over 300,000 frames and 369 point clouds across 98 curated recordings, this resource can serve as a comprehensive benchmark for developing and evaluating non-rigid SLAM, 4D reconstruction, and depth estimation methods.
