  Novel view synthesis (NVS) is increasingly relevant for edge robotics, where compact and incrementally updatable 3D scene models are needed for SLAM, navigation, and inspection under tight memory and latency budgets. Variational Bayesian Gaussian Splatting (VBGS) enables replay-free continual updates for the 3DGS algorithm by maintaining a probabilistic scene model, but its high-precision computations and large intermediate tensors make on-device training impractical. We present a precision-adaptive optimization framework that enables VBGS training on resource-constrained hardware without altering its variational formulation. We (i) profile VBGS to identify memory/latency hotspots, (ii) fuse memory-dominant kernels to reduce materialized intermediate tensors, and (iii) automatically assign operation-level precisions via a mixed-precision search with bounded relative error. Across the Blender, Habitat, and Replica datasets, our optimised pipeline reduces peak memory from 9.44 GB to 1.11 GB and training time from ~234 min to ~61 min on an A5000 GPU, while preserving (and in some cases improving) reconstruction quality of the state-of-the-art VBGS baseline. We also enable for the first time NVS training on a commercial embedded platform, the Jetson Orin Nano, reducing per-frame latency by 19x compared to 3DGS.

  Omnidirectional images are increasingly used in robotics and vision due to their wide field of view. However, extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to panoramic camera models remains challenging, as existing formulations are designed for perspective projections and naive adaptations often introduce distortion and geometric inconsistencies. We present Spherical-GOF, an omnidirectional Gaussian rendering framework built upon Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF). Unlike projection-based rasterization, Spherical-GOF performs GOF ray sampling directly on the unit sphere in spherical ray space, enabling consistent ray-Gaussian interactions for panoramic rendering. To make the spherical ray casting efficient and robust, we derive a conservative spherical bounding rule for fast ray-Gaussian culling and introduce a spherical filtering scheme that adapts Gaussian footprints to distortion-varying panoramic pixel sampling. Extensive experiments on standard panoramic benchmarks (OmniBlender and OmniPhotos) demonstrate competitive photometric quality and substantially improved geometric consistency. Compared with the strongest baseline, Spherical-GOF reduces depth reprojection error by 57% and improves cycle inlier ratio by 21%. Qualitative results show cleaner depth and more coherent normal maps, with strong robustness to global panorama rotations. We further validate generalization on OmniRob, a real-world robotic omnidirectional dataset introduced in this work, featuring UAV and quadruped platforms. The source code and the OmniRob dataset will be released at https://github.com/1170632760/Spherical-GOF.

  Dynamic scene reconstruction in autonomous driving remains a fundamental challenge due to significant temporal variations, moving objects, and complex scene dynamics. Existing feed-forward 3D models have demonstrated strong performance in static reconstruction but still struggle to capture dynamic motion. To address these limitations, we propose DynamicVGGT, a unified feed-forward framework that extends VGGT from static 3D perception to dynamic 4D reconstruction. Our goal is to model point motion within feed-forward 3D models in a dynamic and temporally coherent manner. To this end, we jointly predict the current and future point maps within a shared reference coordinate system, allowing the model to implicitly learn dynamic point representations through temporal correspondence. To efficiently capture temporal dependencies, we introduce a Motion-aware Temporal Attention (MTA) module that learns motion continuity. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting Head that explicitly models point motion by predicting Gaussian velocities using learnable motion tokens under scene flow supervision. It refines dynamic geometry through continuous 3D Gaussian optimization. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that DynamicVGGT significantly outperforms existing methods in reconstruction accuracy, achieving robust feed-forward 4D dynamic scene reconstruction under complex driving scenarios.

  Radiance of real-world scenes typically spans a much wider dynamic range than what standard cameras can capture. While conventional HDR methods merge alternating-exposure frames, these approaches are inherently constrained to 2D pixel-level alignment, often leading to ghosting artifacts and temporal inconsistency in dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we present HDR-NSFF, a paradigm shift from 2D-based merging to 4D spatio-temporal modeling. Our framework reconstructs dynamic HDR radiance fields from alternating-exposure monocular videos by representing the scene as a continuous function of space and time, and is compatible with both neural radiance field and 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) based dynamic representations. This unified end-to-end pipeline explicitly models HDR radiance, 3D scene flow, geometry, and tone-mapping, ensuring physical plausibility and global coherence. We further enhance robustness by (i) extending semantic-based optical flow with DINO features to achieve exposure-invariant motion estimation, and (ii) incorporating a generative prior as a regularizer to compensate for limited observation in monocular captures and saturation-induced information loss. To evaluate HDR space-time view synthesis, we present the first real-world HDR-GoPro dataset specifically designed for dynamic HDR scenes. Experiments demonstrate that HDR-NSFF recovers fine radiance details and coherent dynamics even under challenging exposure variations, thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance in novel space-time view synthesis.
