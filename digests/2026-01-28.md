- **Instance-Guided Radar Depth Estimation for 3D Object Detection**  
  Chen-Chou Lo, Patrick Vandewalle

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  In this paper, we introduce ScenePilot-Bench, a large-scale first-person driving benchmark designed to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving scenarios. ScenePilot-Bench is built upon ScenePilot-4K, a diverse dataset comprising 3,847 hours of driving videos, annotated with multi-granularity information including scene descriptions, risk assessments, key participant identification, ego trajectories, and camera parameters. The benchmark features a four-axis evaluation suite that assesses VLM capabilities in scene understanding, spatial perception, motion planning, and GPT-Score, with safety-aware metrics and cross-region generalization settings. We benchmark representative VLMs on ScenePilot-Bench, providing empirical analyses that clarify current performance boundaries and identify gaps for driving-oriented reasoning. ScenePilot-Bench offers a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing VLMs in safety-critical autonomous driving contexts.

  Yida Lin, Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang, Sam Schofield, Richard Green  
  _2026-01-27_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19461v1 · `cs.CV`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75). DEFOM predictions will serve as pseudo-ground-truth for future benchmarking.

  _2026-01-27_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19853v1 · `eess.SP`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  In this work, we study how to make mmWave radar presence detection more interpretable for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) settings, where camera-based sensing raises privacy concerns. We propose a Generative Latent Alignment (GLA) framework that combines a lightweight convolutional variational autoencoder with a frozen CLIP text encoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of radar Range-Angle (RA) heatmaps. The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to "empty room" and "person present", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the "person present" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas "empty room" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting.

## Drones & Aerial Robotics

- **Perception-to-Pursuit: Track-Centric Temporal Reasoning for Open-World Drone Detection and Autonomous Chasing**  
  Venkatakrishna Reddy Oruganti  
  _2026-01-27_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19318v1 · `cs.RO`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Autonomous drone pursuit requires not only detecting drones but also predicting their trajectories in a manner that enables kinematically feasible interception. Existing tracking methods optimize for prediction accuracy but ignore pursuit feasibility, resulting in trajectories that are physically impossible to intercept 99.9% of the time. We propose Perception-to-Pursuit (P2P), a track-centric temporal reasoning framework that bridges detection and actionable pursuit planning. Our method represents drone motion as compact 8-dimensional tokens capturing velocity, acceleration, scale, and smoothness, enabling a 12-frame causal transformer to reason about future behavior. We introduce the Intercept Success Rate (ISR) metric to measure pursuit feasibility under realistic interceptor constraints. Evaluated on the Anti-UAV-RGBT dataset with 226 real drone sequences, P2P achieves 28.12 pixel average displacement error and 0.597 ISR, representing a 77% improvement in trajectory prediction and 597x improvement in pursuit feasibility over tracking-only baselines, while maintaining perfect drone classification accuracy (100%). Our work demonstrates that temporal reasoning over motion patterns enables both accurate prediction and actionable pursuit planning.

- **A DVL Aided Loosely Coupled Inertial Navigation Strategy for AUVs with Attitude Error Modeling and Variance Propagation**  
  Jin Huang, Zichen Liu, Haoda Li, Zhikun Wang, Ying Chen  
  _2026-01-27_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19509v1 · `cs.RO`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  In underwater navigation systems, strap-down inertial navigation system/Doppler velocity log (SINS/DVL)-based loosely coupled architectures are widely adopted. Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We release the S3LI Vulcano dataset, a multi-modal dataset towards development and benchmarking of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and place recognition algorithms that rely on visual and LiDAR modalities. Several sequences are recorded on the volcanic island of Vulcano, from the Aeolian Islands in Sicily, Italy. The sequences provide users with data from a variety of environments, textures and terrains, including basaltic or iron-rich rocks, geological formations from old lava channels, as well as dry vegetation and water. The data (rmc.dlr.de/s3li_dataset) is accompanied by an open source toolkit (github.com/DLR-RM/s3li-toolkit) providing tools for generating ground truth poses as well as preparation of labelled samples for place recognition tasks.

  _2026-01-27_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19887v1 · `cs.CV`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We present VGGT-SLAM 2.0, a real time RGB feed-forward SLAM system which substantially improves upon VGGT-SLAM for incrementally aligning submaps created from VGGT. Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM. Code will be released upon publication.

- **Enhancing Inverse Perspective Mapping for Automatic Vectorized Road Map Generation**  
  Hongji Liu, Linwei Zheng, Yongjian Li, Mingkai Tang, Xiaoyang Yan, Ming Liu, Jun Ma  
  _2026-01-27_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19536v1 · `cs.RO`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  In this study, we present a low-cost and unified framework for vectorized road mapping leveraging enhanced inverse perspective mapping (IPM). In this framework, Catmull-Rom splines are utilized to characterize lane lines, and all the other ground markings are depicted using polygons uniformly. The results from instance segmentation serve as references to refine the three-dimensional position of spline control points and polygon corner points. In conjunction with this process, the homography matrix of IPM and vehicle poses are optimized simultaneously. Our proposed framework significantly reduces the mapping errors associated with IPM. It also improves the accuracy of the initial IPM homography matrix and the predicted vehicle poses. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations imposed by the coplanarity assumption in IPM. These enhancements enable IPM to be effectively applied to vectorized road mapping, which serves a cost-effective solution with enhanced accuracy. In addition, our framework generalizes road map elements to include all common ground markings and lane lines. The proposed framework is evaluated in two different practical scenarios, and the test results show that our method can automatically generate high-precision maps with near-centimeter-level accuracy. Importantly, the optimized IPM matrix achieves an accuracy comparable to that of manual calibration, while the accuracy of vehicle poses is also significantly improved.

- **Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Invariant Trajectories for Multimodal Large Language Model Editing**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Code localization constitutes a key bottleneck in automated software development pipelines. While concurrent tool execution can enhance discovery speed, current agents demonstrate a 34.9\% redundant invocation rate, which negates parallelism benefits. We propose \textbf{FuseSearch}, reformulating parallel code localization as a \textbf{joint quality-efficiency optimization} task. Through defining \textbf{tool efficiency} -- the ratio of unique information gain to invocation count -- we utilize a two-phase SFT and RL training approach for learning adaptive parallel strategies. Different from fixed-breadth approaches, FuseSearch dynamically modulates search breadth according to task context, evolving from exploration phases to refinement stages. Evaluated on SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves SOTA-level performance (84.7\% file-level and 56.4\% function-level $F_1$ scores) with 93.6\% speedup, utilizing 67.7\% fewer turns and 68.9\% fewer tokens. Results indicate that efficiency-aware training naturally improves quality through eliminating noisy redundant signals, enabling high-performance cost-effective localization agents.

- **Bridging Information Asymmetry: A Hierarchical Framework for Deterministic Blind Face Restoration**  
  Zhengjian Yao, Jiakui Hu, Kaiwen Li, Hangzhou He, Xinliang Zhang, Shuang Zeng, Lei Zhu, Yanye Lu  
  _2026-01-27_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19506v1 · `cs.CV`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.

- **Fast Converging 3D Gaussian Splatting for 1-Minute Reconstruction**  
  Ziyu Zhang, Tianle Liu, Diantao Tu, Shuhan Shen  
  _2026-01-27_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19489v1 · `cs.CV`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We present a fast 3DGS reconstruction pipeline designed to converge within one minute, developed for the SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS Fast Reconstruction Challenge. The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition.

- **Metric $k$-clustering using only Weak Comparison Oracles**  
  Rahul Raychaudhury, Aryan Esmailpour, Sainyam Galhotra, Stavros Sintos  
  _2026-01-27_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19333v1 · `cs.LG`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning. However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost. Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\cdot k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms.

## Navigation, Planning & Control

- **Self-Supervised Path Planning in Unstructured Environments via Global-Guided Differentiable Hard Constraint Projection**

  _2026-01-27_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19354v1 · `cs.RO`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Deploying deep learning agents for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments faces critical challenges regarding safety, data scarcity, and limited computational resources. Traditional solvers often suffer from high latency, while emerging learning-based approaches struggle to ensure deterministic feasibility. To bridge the gap from embodied to embedded intelligence, we propose a self-supervised framework incorporating a differentiable hard constraint projection layer for runtime assurance. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold. Extensive benchmarks on a test set of 20,000 scenarios demonstrate an 88.75\% success rate, substantiating the enhanced operational safety. Closed-loop experiments in CARLA further validate the physical realizability of the planned paths under dynamic constraints. Furthermore, deployment verification on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX confirms an inference latency of 94 ms, showing real-time feasibility on resource-constrained embedded hardware. This framework offers a generalized paradigm for embedding physical laws into neural architectures, providing a viable direction for solving constrained optimization in mechatronics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Autonomy and independent navigation are vital to daily life but remain challenging for individuals with blindness. Robotic systems can enhance mobility and confidence by providing intelligent navigation assistance. However, fully autonomous systems may reduce users' sense of control, even when they wish to remain actively involved. Although collaboration between user and robot has been recognized as important, little is known about how perceptions of this relationship change with repeated use. We present a repeated exposure study with six blind participants who interacted with a navigation-assistive robot in a real-world museum. Participants completed tasks such as navigating crowds, approaching lines, and encountering obstacles. Findings show that participants refined their strategies over time, developing clearer preferences about when to rely on the robot versus act independently. This work provides insights into how strategies and preferences evolve with repeated interaction and offers design implications for robots that adapt to user needs over time.

  Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.

Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance.

  Scenes are continuously undergoing dynamic changes in the real world. However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization. (3) Control (human body): we equip the virtual human with Human-Scene Interaction Diffusion Model, which generates high-fidelity interaction motions conditioned on multimodal inputs. To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate Dyn-HSI, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and generates high-quality human-scene interaction motions in both static and dynamic settings.

  Tactile memory, the ability to store and retrieve touch-based experience, is critical for contact-rich tasks such as key insertion under uncertainty. To replicate this capability, we introduce Tactile Memory with Soft Robot (TaMeSo-bot), a system that integrates a soft wrist with tactile retrieval-based control to enable safe and robust manipulation. The soft wrist allows safe contact exploration during data collection, while tactile memory reuses past demonstrations via retrieval for flexible adaptation to unseen scenarios. The core of this system is the Masked Tactile Trajectory Transformer (MAT$^\text{3}$), which jointly models spatiotemporal interactions between robot actions, distributed tactile feedback, force-torque measurements, and proprioceptive signals. Through masked-token prediction, MAT$^\text{3}$ learns rich spatiotemporal representations by inferring missing sensory information from context, autonomously extracting task-relevant features without explicit subtask segmentation. We validate our approach on peg-in-hole tasks with diverse pegs and conditions in real-robot experiments. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that MAT$^\text{3}$ achieves higher success rates than the baselines over all conditions and shows remarkable capability to adapt to unseen pegs and conditions.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently empowered agentic frameworks to exhibit advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their integration in robotic control pipelines remains limited in two aspects: (1) prior \ac{llm}-based approaches often lack modular, agentic execution mechanisms, limiting their ability to plan, reflect on outcomes, and revise actions in a closed-loop manner; and (2) existing benchmarks for manipulation tasks focus on low-level control and do not systematically evaluate multistep reasoning and linguistic variation. In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution. Results reveal Claude-4.1-Opus as the top closed-source model and Falcon-H1-7B as the top open-source model under CaP.

  Generalizing beyond the training domain in image-based behavior cloning remains challenging. Existing methods address individual axes of generalization, workspace shifts, viewpoint changes, and cross-embodiment transfer, yet they are typically developed in isolation and often rely on complex pipelines. We introduce PALM (Perception Alignment for Local Manipulation), which leverages the invariance of local action distributions between out-of-distribution (OOD) and demonstrated domains to address these OOD shifts concurrently, without additional input modalities, model changes, or data collection. PALM modularizes the manipulation policy into coarse global components and a local policy for fine-grained actions. We reduce the discrepancy between in-domain and OOD inputs at the local policy level by enforcing local visual focus and consistent proprioceptive representation, allowing the policy to retrieve invariant local actions under OOD conditions. Experiments show that PALM limits OOD performance drops to 8% in simulation and 24% in the real world, compared to 45% and 77% for baselines.

  Synthetic simulation data and real-world human data provide scalable alternatives to circumvent the prohibitive costs of robot data collection. However, these sources suffer from the sim-to-real visual gap and the human-to-robot embodiment gap, respectively, which limits the policy's generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we identify a natural yet underexplored complementarity between these sources: simulation offers the robot action that human data lacks, while human data provides the real-world observation that simulation struggles to render. Motivated by this insight, we present SimHum, a co-training framework to simultaneously extract kinematic prior from simulated robot actions and visual prior from real-world human observations. Based on the two complementary priors, we achieve data-efficient and generalizable robotic manipulation in real-world tasks. Empirically, SimHum outperforms the baseline by up to $\mathbf{40\%}$ under the same data collection budget, and achieves a $\mathbf{62.5\%}$ OOD success with only 80 real data, outperforming the real only baseline by $7.1\times$.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Interactive recommender systems can dynamically adapt to user feedback, but often suffer from content homogeneity and filter bubble effects due to overfitting short-term user preferences. While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space. This hierarchical design narrows the action space, enhances planning efficiency, and mitigates overexposure to redundant content. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LERL significantly improves long-term user satisfaction when compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of LERL is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/code3-18D3/.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Humanoid control often leverages motion priors from human demonstrations to encourage natural behaviors. However, such demonstrations are frequently suboptimal or misaligned with robotic tasks due to embodiment differences, retargeting errors, and task-irrelevant variations, causing naïve imitation to degrade task performance. Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions. This exposes a fundamental limitation of linear reward mixing in adversarial imitation learning. We propose \emph{Task-Centric Motion Priors} (TCMP), a task-priority adversarial imitation framework that treats imitation as a conditional regularizer rather than a co-equal objective. TCMP maximizes task improvement while incorporating imitation signals only when they are compatible with task progress, yielding an adaptive, geometry-aware update that preserves task-feasible descent and suppresses harmful imitation under misalignment. We provide theoretical analysis of gradient conflict and task-priority stationary points, and validate our claims through humanoid control experiments demonstrating robust task performance with consistent motion style under noisy demonstrations.

  Existing human-robot interaction systems often lack mechanisms for sustained personalization and dynamic adaptation in multi-user environments, limiting their effectiveness in real-world deployments. We present HARMONI, a multimodal personalization framework that leverages large language models to enable socially assistive robots to manage long-term multi-user interactions. The framework integrates four key modules: (i) a perception module that identifies active speakers and extracts multimodal input; (ii) a world modeling module that maintains representations of the environment and short-term conversational context; (iii) a user modeling module that updates long-term speaker-specific profiles; and (iv) a generation module that produces contextually grounded and ethically informed responses. Through extensive evaluation and ablation studies on four datasets, as well as a real-world scenario-driven user-study in a nursing home environment, we demonstrate that HARMONI supports robust speaker identification, online memory updating, and ethically aligned personalization, outperforming baseline LLM-driven approaches in user modeling accuracy, personalization quality, and user satisfaction.

  With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.

  Emerging 6G networks rely on complex cross-layer optimization, yet manually translating high-level intents into mathematical formulations remains a bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, monolithic approaches often lack sufficient domain grounding, constraint awareness, and verification capabilities. To address this, we present ComAgent, a multi-LLM agentic AI framework. ComAgent employs a closed-loop Perception-Planning-Action-Reflection cycle, coordinating specialized agents for literature search, coding, and scoring to autonomously generate solver-ready formulations and reproducible simulations. By iteratively decomposing problems and self-correcting errors, the framework effectively bridges the gap between user intent and execution. Evaluations demonstrate that ComAgent achieves expert-comparable performance in complex beamforming optimization and outperforms monolithic LLMs across diverse wireless tasks, highlighting its potential for automating design in emerging wireless networks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Reinforcement learning (RL) can be highly effective at learning goal-reaching policies, but it typically does not provide formal guarantees that the goal will always be reached. A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75). DEFOM predictions will serve as pseudo-ground-truth for future benchmarking.

  Personalization in social robots refers to the ability of the robot to meet the needs and/or preferences of an individual user. Existing approaches typically rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware responses based on user metadata and historical interactions or on adaptive methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) to learn from users' immediate reactions in real time. However, these approaches fall short of comprehensively capturing user preferences-including long-term, short-term, and fine-grained aspects-, and of using them to rank and select actions, proactively personalize interactions, and ensure ethically responsible adaptations. To address the limitations, we propose drawing on recommender systems (RSs), which specialize in modeling user preferences and providing personalized recommendations. To ensure the integration of RS techniques is well-grounded and seamless throughout the social robot pipeline, we (i) align the paradigms underlying social robots and RSs, (ii) identify key techniques that can enhance personalization in social robots, and (iii) design them as modular, plug-and-play components. This work not only establishes a framework for integrating RS techniques into social robots but also opens a pathway for deep collaboration between the RS and HRI communities, accelerating innovation in both fields.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Existing value-based online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer from slow policy exploitation due to ineffective exploration and delayed policy updates. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL. Experimental results show that IRA can significantly improve the learning efficiency and final performance of online RL algorithms on eight MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

  Controlling high-dimensional systems in biological and robotic applications is challenging due to expansive state-action spaces, where effective exploration is critical. Commonly used exploration strategies in reinforcement learning are largely undirected with sharp degradation as action dimensionality grows. Many existing methods resort to dimensionality reduction, which constrains policy expressiveness and forfeits system flexibility. We introduce Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex), a scalable reinforcement learning method that conducts exploration directly in the native high-dimensional action space. During training, Qflex traverses actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients rather than isotropic noise. Our proposed method substantially outperforms representative online reinforcement learning baselines across diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks. Qflex also successfully controls a full-body human musculoskeletal model to perform agile, complex movements, demonstrating superior scalability and sample efficiency in very high-dimensional settings. Our results indicate that value-guided flows offer a principled and practical route to exploration at scale.

  Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Low-altitude vision systems are becoming a critical infrastructure for smart city governance. However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves performance while avoiding the need of fine-tuning for any task-specific individual components. We believe our work offers a new perspective and foundation for future studies on management-aware low-altitude vision-language systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.

  Production LLM deployments serve diverse workloads where cost and quality requirements vary by customer tier, time of day, and query criticality. Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle. Cost savings reach 89.8% versus the best fixed model.

Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering

  While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks. Our code is released at https://github.com/MarquisDarwin/EAWM.

  Stabilizing a dynamical system is a fundamental problem that serves as a cornerstone for many complex tasks in the field of control systems. The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is an NP-hard problem with applications in warehouse automation and multi-robot coordination. Learning-based MAPF solvers offer fast and scalable planning but often produce feasible trajectories that contain unnecessary or oscillatory movements. We propose Judgelight, a post-optimization method that improves trajectory quality after a MAPF solver generates a feasible schedule. Judgelight collapses closed subwalks in agents' trajectories to remove redundant movements while preserving all feasibility constraints. We formalize this process as MAPF-Collapse, prove that it is NP-hard, and present an exact optimization approach by formulating it as integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Experimental results show Judgelight consistently reduces solution cost by around 20%, particularly for learning-based solvers, producing trajectories that are better suited for real-world deployment.

  Tactile memory, the ability to store and retrieve touch-based experience, is critical for contact-rich tasks such as key insertion under uncertainty. To replicate this capability, we introduce Tactile Memory with Soft Robot (TaMeSo-bot), a system that integrates a soft wrist with tactile retrieval-based control to enable safe and robust manipulation. The soft wrist allows safe contact exploration during data collection, while tactile memory reuses past demonstrations via retrieval for flexible adaptation to unseen scenarios. The core of this system is the Masked Tactile Trajectory Transformer (MAT$^\text{3}$), which jointly models spatiotemporal interactions between robot actions, distributed tactile feedback, force-torque measurements, and proprioceptive signals. Through masked-token prediction, MAT$^\text{3}$ learns rich spatiotemporal representations by inferring missing sensory information from context, autonomously extracting task-relevant features without explicit subtask segmentation. We validate our approach on peg-in-hole tasks with diverse pegs and conditions in real-robot experiments. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that MAT$^\text{3}$ achieves higher success rates than the baselines over all conditions and shows remarkable capability to adapt to unseen pegs and conditions.

  Programming by demonstration is a strategy to simplify the robot programming process for non-experts via human demonstrations. However, its adoption for bimanual tasks is an underexplored problem due to the complexity of hand coordination, which also hinders data recording. This paper presents a novel one-shot method for processing a single RGB video of a bimanual task demonstration to generate an execution plan for a dual-arm robotic system. To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination. We validated the effectiveness of this framework through multiple subject video demonstrations, which we collected and made open-source, and exploiting data from an external, publicly available dataset. Comparisons with existing methods revealed significant improvements in generating a centralized execution plan for coordinating two-arm systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Deploying deep learning agents for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments faces critical challenges regarding safety, data scarcity, and limited computational resources. Traditional solvers often suffer from high latency, while emerging learning-based approaches struggle to ensure deterministic feasibility. To bridge the gap from embodied to embedded intelligence, we propose a self-supervised framework incorporating a differentiable hard constraint projection layer for runtime assurance. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold. Extensive benchmarks on a test set of 20,000 scenarios demonstrate an 88.75\% success rate, substantiating the enhanced operational safety. Closed-loop experiments in CARLA further validate the physical realizability of the planned paths under dynamic constraints. Furthermore, deployment verification on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX confirms an inference latency of 94 ms, showing real-time feasibility on resource-constrained embedded hardware. This framework offers a generalized paradigm for embedding physical laws into neural architectures, providing a viable direction for solving constrained optimization in mechatronics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.

  Modern AI systems increasingly comprise multiple interconnected neural networks to tackle complex inference tasks. Testing such systems for robustness and safety entails significant challenges. Current state-of-the-art robustness testing techniques, whether black-box or white-box, have been proposed and implemented for single-network models and do not scale well to multi-network pipelines. We propose a modular robustness testing framework that applies a given set of perturbations to test data. Our testing framework supports (1) a component-wise system analysis to isolate errors and (2) reasoning about error propagation across the neural network modules. The testing framework is architecture and modality agnostic and can be applied across domains. We apply the framework to a real-world autonomous rail inspection system composed of multiple deep networks and successfully demonstrate how our approach enables fine-grained robustness analysis beyond conventional end-to-end metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  In this study, we present a low-cost and unified framework for vectorized road mapping leveraging enhanced inverse perspective mapping (IPM). In this framework, Catmull-Rom splines are utilized to characterize lane lines, and all the other ground markings are depicted using polygons uniformly. The results from instance segmentation serve as references to refine the three-dimensional position of spline control points and polygon corner points. In conjunction with this process, the homography matrix of IPM and vehicle poses are optimized simultaneously. Our proposed framework significantly reduces the mapping errors associated with IPM. It also improves the accuracy of the initial IPM homography matrix and the predicted vehicle poses. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations imposed by the coplanarity assumption in IPM. These enhancements enable IPM to be effectively applied to vectorized road mapping, which serves a cost-effective solution with enhanced accuracy. In addition, our framework generalizes road map elements to include all common ground markings and lane lines. The proposed framework is evaluated in two different practical scenarios, and the test results show that our method can automatically generate high-precision maps with near-centimeter-level accuracy. Importantly, the optimized IPM matrix achieves an accuracy comparable to that of manual calibration, while the accuracy of vehicle poses is also significantly improved.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  In underwater navigation systems, strap-down inertial navigation system/Doppler velocity log (SINS/DVL)-based loosely coupled architectures are widely adopted. Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Reinforcement learning (RL) can be highly effective at learning goal-reaching policies, but it typically does not provide formal guarantees that the goal will always be reached. A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency.

  Industry 5.0 focuses on human-centric collaboration between humans and robots, prioritizing safety, comfort, and trust. This study introduces a data-driven framework to assess trust using behavioral indicators. The framework employs a Preference-Based Optimization algorithm to generate trust-enhancing trajectories based on operator feedback. This feedback serves as ground truth for training machine learning models to predict trust levels from behavioral indicators. The framework was tested in a chemical industry scenario where a robot assisted a human operator in mixing chemicals. Machine learning models classified trust with over 80\% accuracy, with the Voting Classifier achieving 84.07\% accuracy and an AUC-ROC score of 0.90. These findings underscore the effectiveness of data-driven methods in assessing trust within human-robot collaboration, emphasizing the valuable role behavioral indicators play in predicting the dynamics of human trust.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.

  Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

  Generalizing beyond the training domain in image-based behavior cloning remains challenging. Existing methods address individual axes of generalization, workspace shifts, viewpoint changes, and cross-embodiment transfer, yet they are typically developed in isolation and often rely on complex pipelines. We introduce PALM (Perception Alignment for Local Manipulation), which leverages the invariance of local action distributions between out-of-distribution (OOD) and demonstrated domains to address these OOD shifts concurrently, without additional input modalities, model changes, or data collection. PALM modularizes the manipulation policy into coarse global components and a local policy for fine-grained actions. We reduce the discrepancy between in-domain and OOD inputs at the local policy level by enforcing local visual focus and consistent proprioceptive representation, allowing the policy to retrieve invariant local actions under OOD conditions. Experiments show that PALM limits OOD performance drops to 8% in simulation and 24% in the real world, compared to 45% and 77% for baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.

  Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage. However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.

  Humanoid control often leverages motion priors from human demonstrations to encourage natural behaviors. However, such demonstrations are frequently suboptimal or misaligned with robotic tasks due to embodiment differences, retargeting errors, and task-irrelevant variations, causing naïve imitation to degrade task performance. Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions. This exposes a fundamental limitation of linear reward mixing in adversarial imitation learning. We propose \emph{Task-Centric Motion Priors} (TCMP), a task-priority adversarial imitation framework that treats imitation as a conditional regularizer rather than a co-equal objective. TCMP maximizes task improvement while incorporating imitation signals only when they are compatible with task progress, yielding an adaptive, geometry-aware update that preserves task-feasible descent and suppresses harmful imitation under misalignment. We provide theoretical analysis of gradient conflict and task-priority stationary points, and validate our claims through humanoid control experiments demonstrating robust task performance with consistent motion style under noisy demonstrations.

Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\% and surpassing all baselines.

  Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering

  Mobile agents have made progress toward reliable smartphone automation, yet performance in complex applications remains limited by incomplete knowledge and weak generalization to unseen environments. We introduce a curiosity driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes uncertainty during execution as a curiosity score. When this score exceeds a threshold, the system retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories. Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model. Case studies further confirm that AppCards reduce ambiguity, shorten exploration, and support stable execution trajectories. Task trajectories are publicly available at https://lisalsj.github.io/Droidrun-appcard/.

  Underwater 3D reconstruction and appearance restoration are hindered by the complex optical properties of water, such as wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods struggle with slow rendering speeds and suboptimal color restoration, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) inherently lacks the capability to model complex volumetric scattering effects. To address these issues, we introduce WaterClear-GS, the first pure 3DGS-based framework that explicitly integrates underwater optical properties of local attenuation and scattering into Gaussian primitives, eliminating the need for an auxiliary medium network. Our method employs a dual-branch optimization strategy to ensure underwater photometric consistency while naturally recovering water-free appearances. This strategy is enhanced by depth-guided geometry regularization and perception-driven image loss, together with exposure constraints, spatially-adaptive regularization, and physically guided spectral regularization, which collectively enforce local 3D coherence and maintain natural visual perception. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that WaterClear-GS achieves outstanding performance on both novel view synthesis (NVS) and underwater image restoration (UIR) tasks, while maintaining real-time rendering. The code will be available at https://buaaxrzhang.github.io/WaterClear-GS/.

  We present a fast 3DGS reconstruction pipeline designed to converge within one minute, developed for the SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS Fast Reconstruction Challenge. The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition.
