  Robust and accurate perception of dynamic objects and map elements is crucial for autonomous vehicles performing safe navigation in complex traffic scenarios. While vision-only methods have become the de facto standard due to their technical advances, they can benefit from effective and cost-efficient fusion with radar measurements. In this work, we advance fusion methods by repurposing Gaussian Splatting as an efficient universal view transformer that bridges the view disparity gap, mapping both image pixels and radar points into a common Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation. Our main contribution is GaussianCaR, an end-to-end network for BEV segmentation that, unlike prior BEV fusion methods, leverages Gaussian Splatting to map raw sensor information into latent features for efficient camera-radar fusion. Our architecture combines multi-scale fusion with a transformer decoder to efficiently extract BEV features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance on par with, or even surpassing, the state of the art on BEV segmentation tasks (57.3%, 82.9%, and 50.1% IoU for vehicles, roads, and lane dividers) on the nuScenes dataset, while maintaining a 3.2x faster inference runtime.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Function offloading is a promising solution to address limitations concerning computational capacity and available energy of Connected Automated Vehicles~(CAVs) or other autonomous robots by distributing computational tasks between local and remote computing devices in form of distributed services. This paper presents a generic function offloading framework that can be used to offload an arbitrary set of computational tasks with a focus on autonomous driving. To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV. We apply the proposed framework on the use case of service-oriented trajectory planning, where we offload the trajectory planning task of CAVs to a Multi-Access Edge Computing~(MEC) server. The evaluation is conducted in both simulation and real-world application. It demonstrates the potential of the function offloading framework to guarantee the QoS for trajectory planning while improving the computational efficiency of the CAVs. Moreover, the simulation results also show the adaptability of the framework to diverse scenarios involving simultaneous offloading requests from multiple CAVs.

  Accurately predicting pedestrian motion is crucial for safe and reliable autonomous driving in complex urban environments. In this work, we present a 3D vehicle-conditioned pedestrian pose forecasting framework that explicitly incorporates surrounding vehicle information. To support this, we enhance the Waymo-3DSkelMo dataset with aligned 3D vehicle bounding boxes, enabling realistic modeling of multi-agent pedestrian-vehicle interactions. We introduce a sampling scheme to categorize scenes by pedestrian and vehicle count, facilitating training across varying interaction complexities. Our proposed network adapts the TBIFormer architecture with a dedicated vehicle encoder and pedestrian-vehicle interaction cross-attention module to fuse pedestrian and vehicle features, allowing predictions to be conditioned on both historical pedestrian motion and surrounding vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy and validate different approaches for modeling pedestrian-vehicle interactions, highlighting the importance of vehicle-aware 3D pose prediction for autonomous driving.

- **Robustness Is a Function, Not a Number: A Factorized Comprehensive Study of OOD Robustness in Vision-Based Driving**

  _2026-02-09_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09018v1 · `cs.RO`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Out of distribution (OOD) robustness in autonomous driving is often reduced to a single number, hiding what breaks a policy. We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\rightarrow$ urban and day $\rightarrow$ night ($\sim 31\%$ each); actor swaps $\sim 10\%$, moderate rain $\sim 7\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\% \rightarrow 70.1\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Point cloud is a prevalent 3D data representation format with significant application values in immersive media, autonomous driving, digital heritage protection, etc. However, the large data size of point clouds poses challenges to transmission and storage, which influences the wide deployments. Therefore, point cloud compression plays a crucial role in practical applications for both human and machine perception optimization. To this end, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has established two standards for point cloud compression, including Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) and Video-based Point Cloud Compression (V-PCC). In the meantime, the Audio Video coding Standard (AVS) Workgroup of China also have launched and completed the development for its first generation point cloud compression standard, namely AVS PCC. This new standardization effort has adopted many new coding tools and techniques, which are different from the other counterpart standards. This paper reviews the AVS PCC standard from two perspectives, i.e., the related technologies and performance comparisons.

- **Multi-Staged Framework for Safety Analysis of Offloaded Services in Distributed Intelligent Transportation Systems**  
  Robin Dehler, Oliver Schumann, Jona Ruof, Michael Buchholz  
  _2026-02-09_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08821v1 · `cs.RO`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  The integration of service-oriented architectures (SOA) with function offloading for distributed, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) offers the opportunity for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to extend their locally available services. One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work. The evaluation compares the performance of the extended framework considering computational complexity, with energy savings being a major motivation for function offloading, and its capability to detect data from corrupted remote services.

- **High-Speed Vision-Based Flight in Clutter with Safety-Shielded Reinforcement Learning**  
  Jiarui Zhang, Chengyong Lei, Chengjiang Dai, Lijie Wang, Zhichao Han, Fei Gao  
  _2026-02-09_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08653v1 · `cs.RO`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in complex missions that demand reliable autonomous navigation and robust obstacle avoidance. However, traditional modular pipelines often incur cumulative latency, whereas purely reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically provide limited formal safety guarantees. To bridge this gap, we propose an end-to-end RL framework augmented with model-based safety mechanisms. We incorporate physical priors in both training and deployment. During training, we design a physics-informed reward structure that provides global navigational guidance. During deployment, we integrate a real-time safety filter that projects the policy outputs onto a provably safe set to enforce strict collision-avoidance constraints. This hybrid architecture reconciles high-speed flight with robust safety assurances. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms both traditional planners and recent end-to-end obstacle avoidance approaches based on differentiable physics. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization, enabling reliable high-speed navigation in dense clutter and challenging outdoor forest environments at velocities up to 7.5m/s.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  According to the United Nations, wildfire frequency and intensity are projected to increase by approximately 14% by 2030 and 30% by 2050 due to global warming, posing critical threats to life, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Conventional disaster management frameworks rely on static simulations and passive data acquisition, hindering their ability to adapt to arbitrarily evolving wildfire episodes in real-time. To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining. Our results indicate marked reductions in detection-to-intervention latency and more effective resource coordination versus traditional systems. By uniting real-time bidirectional DTs with agentic AI, IVSR offers a scalable, semi-automated decision-support paradigm for proactive, adaptive wildfire disaster management.

- **A Precise Real-Time Force-Aware Grasping System for Robust Aerial Manipulation**  
  Kenghou Hoi, Yuze Wu, Annan Ding, Junjie Wang, Anke Zhao, Chengqian Zhang, Fei Gao  
  _2026-02-09_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08599v1 · `cs.RO`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Aerial manipulation requires force-aware capabilities to enable safe and effective grasping and physical interaction. Previous works often rely on heavy, expensive force sensors unsuitable for typical quadrotor platforms, or perform grasping without force feedback, risking damage to fragile objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel force-aware grasping framework incorporating six low-cost, sensitive skin-like tactile sensors. We introduce a magnetic-based tactile sensing module that provides high-precision three-dimensional force measurements. We eliminate geomagnetic interference through a reference Hall sensor and simplify the calibration process compared to previous work. The proposed framework enables precise force-aware grasping control, allowing safe manipulation of fragile objects and real-time weight measurement of grasped items. The system is validated through comprehensive real-world experiments, including balloon grasping, dynamic load variation tests, and ablation studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in various aerial manipulation scenarios. Our approach achieves fully onboard operation without external motion capture systems, significantly enhancing the practicality of force-sensitive aerial manipulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  This paper is based on Bylander's results on the computational complexity of propositional STRIPS planning. He showed that when only ground literals are permitted, determining plan existence is PSPACE-complete even if operators are limited to two preconditions and two postconditions. While NP-hardness is settled, it is unknown whether propositional STRIPS with operators that only have one precondition and one effect is NP-complete. We shed light on the question whether this small solution hypothesis for STRIPS$^1_1$ is true, calling a SAT solver for small instances, introducing the literal graph, and mapping it to Petri nets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Photorealistic color retouching plays a vital role in visual content creation, yet manual retouching remains inaccessible to non-experts due to its reliance on specialized expertise. Reference-based methods offer a promising alternative by transferring the preset color of a reference image to a source image. However, these approaches often operate as novice learners, performing global color mappings derived from pixel-level statistics, without a true understanding of semantic context or human aesthetics. To address this issue, we propose SemiNFT, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based retouching framework that mirrors the trajectory of human artistic training: beginning with rigid imitation and evolving into intuitive creation. Specifically, SemiNFT is first taught with paired triplets to acquire basic structural preservation and color mapping skills, and then advanced to reinforcement learning (RL) on unpaired data to cultivate nuanced aesthetic perception. Crucially, during the RL stage, to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old skills, we design a hybrid online-offline reward mechanism that anchors aesthetic exploration with structural review. % experiments Extensive experiments show that SemiNFT not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard preset transfer benchmarks but also demonstrates remarkable intelligence in zero-shot tasks, such as black-and-white photo colorization and cross-domain (anime-to-photo) preset transfer. These results confirm that SemiNFT transcends simple statistical matching and achieves a sophisticated level of aesthetic comprehension.

- **GEBench: Benchmarking Image Generation Models as GUI Environments**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

- **Diffusion-Inspired Reconfiguration of Transformers for Uncertainty Calibration**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Uncertainty calibration in pre-trained transformers is critical for their reliable deployment in risk-sensitive applications. Yet, most existing pre-trained transformers do not have a principled mechanism for uncertainty propagation through their feature transformation stack. In this work, we propose a diffusion-inspired reconfiguration of transformers in which each feature transformation block is modeled as a probabilistic mapping. Composing these probabilistic mappings reveals a probability path that mimics the structure of a diffusion process, transporting data mass from the input distribution to the pre-trained feature distribution. This probability path can then be recompiled on a diffusion process with a unified transition model to enable principled propagation of representation uncertainty throughout the pre-trained model's architecture while maintaining its original predictive performance. Empirical results across a variety of vision and language benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior calibration and predictive accuracy compared to existing uncertainty-aware transformers.

- **AnomSeer: Reinforcing Multimodal LLMs to Reason for Time-Series Anomaly Detection**  
  Junru Zhang, Lang Feng, Haoran Shi, Xu Guo, Han Yu, Yabo Dong, Duanqing Xu  
  _2026-02-09_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08868v1 · `cs.LG`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is an emerging area, yet a persistent challenge remains: MLLMs rely on coarse time-series heuristics but struggle with multi-dimensional, detailed reasoning, which is vital for understanding complex time-series data. We present AnomSeer to address this by reinforcing the model to ground its reasoning in precise, structural details of time series, unifying anomaly classification, localization, and explanation. At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms). Building on this, we propose a novel time-series grounded policy optimization (TimerPO) that incorporates two additional components beyond standard reinforcement learning: a time-series grounded advantage based on optimal transport and an orthogonal projection to ensure this auxiliary granular signal does not interfere with the primary detection objective. Across diverse anomaly scenarios, AnomSeer, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct, outperforms larger commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o) in classification and localization accuracy, particularly on point- and frequency-driven exceptions. Moreover, it produces plausible time-series reasoning traces that support its conclusions.

- **Kirin: Improving ANN efficiency with SNN Hybridization**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly large language models (LLMs), demonstrate powerful inference capabilities but consume substantial energy. Conversely, spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency due to their binary and event-driven characteristics, thus motivating the study of ANN-to-SNN conversion. In this process, quantization plays a pivotal role, mapping LLMs' floating-point parameters to discrete SNN parameters via the temporal dimension of the time window. However, several challenges remain in the conversion process: (i) converting high bit-width quantization values into binary spikes requires longer time windows, increasing system latency; and (ii) the inherent trade-off between the information loss of single-spike schemes and the energy costs of multi-spike ones in SNN. To address these challenges, we propose Kirin, a integer and spike hybrid based SNN to achieve accuracy lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion with time and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first propose a Spike Matrix Hybridization strategy that encoding low bit-width parameters that leading to small time window size into binary spikes while preserving the rest in integer format, thereby reducing the overall latency of SNN execution. Second, we introduce a silence threshold mechanism to regulate the timing of single-spike firing, ensuring the output is mathematically equivalent to the LLM's output and preserves accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Kirin, under a W4A4\&8 quantization setting, achieves near-FP16 accuracy while reducing energy consumption by up to 84.66\% and shortening time steps by 93.75\%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Root cause localization remain challenging in complex and large-scale microservice architectures. The complex fault propagation among microservices and the high dimensionality of telemetry data, including metrics, logs, and traces, limit the effectiveness of existing root cause analysis (RCA) methods. In this paper, a residual-connection-based RCA method using large language model (LLM), named RC-LLM, is proposed. A residual-like hierarchical fusion structure is designed to integrate multi-source telemetry data, while the contextual reasoning capability of large language models is leveraged to model temporal and cross-microservice causal dependencies. Experimental results on CCF-AIOps microservice datasets demonstrate that RC-LLM achieves strong accuracy and efficiency in root cause analysis.

- **FreqLens: Interpretable Frequency Attribution for Time Series Forecasting**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Time series forecasting models often lack interpretability, limiting their adoption in domains requiring explainable predictions. We propose \textsc{FreqLens}, an interpretable forecasting framework that discovers and attributes predictions to learnable frequency components. \textsc{FreqLens} introduces two key innovations: (1) \emph{learnable frequency discovery} -- frequency bases are parameterized via sigmoid mapping and learned from data with diversity regularization, enabling automatic discovery of dominant periodic patterns without domain knowledge; and (2) \emph{axiomatic frequency attribution} -- a theoretically grounded framework that provably satisfies Completeness, Faithfulness, Null-Frequency, and Symmetry axioms, with per-frequency attributions equivalent to Shapley values. On Traffic and Weather datasets, \textsc{FreqLens} achieves competitive or superior performance while discovering physically meaningful frequencies: all 5 independent runs discover the 24-hour daily cycle ($24.6 \pm 0.1$h, 2.5\% error) and 12-hour half-daily cycle ($11.8 \pm 0.1$h, 1.6\% error) on Traffic, and weekly cycles ($10\times$ longer than the input window) on Weather. These results demonstrate genuine frequency-level knowledge discovery with formal theoretical guarantees on attribution quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Do language models make decisions under uncertainty like humans do, and what role does chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning play in the underlying decision process? We introduce an active probabilistic reasoning task that cleanly separates sampling (actively acquiring evidence) from inference (integrating evidence toward a decision). Benchmarking humans and a broad set of contemporary large language models against near-optimal reference policies reveals a consistent pattern: extended reasoning is the key determinant of strong performance, driving large gains in inference and producing belief trajectories that become strikingly human-like, while yielding only modest improvements in active sampling. To explain these differences, we fit a mechanistic model that captures systematic deviations from optimal behavior via four interpretable latent variables: memory, strategy, choice bias, and occlusion awareness. This model places humans and models in a shared low-dimensional cognitive space, reproduces behavioral signatures across agents, and shows how chain-of-thought shifts language models toward human-like regimes of evidence accumulation and belief-to-choice mapping, tightening alignment in inference while leaving a persistent gap in information acquisition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  The increasing carrier frequencies and growing physical dimensions of antenna arrays in modern wireless systems are driving renewed interest in localization and sensing under near-field conditions. In this paper, we analyze the Ziv-Zakai Bound (ZZB) for near-field localization and sensing operated with large antenna arrays, which offers a tighter characterization of estimation accuracy compared to traditional bounds such as the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB), especially in low signal-to-noise ratio or threshold regions. Leveraging spherical wavefront and array geometry in the signal model, we evaluate the ZZB for distance and angle estimation, investigating the dependence of the accuracy on key signal and system parameters such as array geometry, wavelength, and target position. Our analysis highlights the transition behavior of the ZZB and underscores the fundamental limitations and opportunities for accurate near-field sensing.

While vision-only methods have become the de facto standard due to their technical advances, they can benefit from effective and cost-efficient fusion with radar measurements. In this work, we advance fusion methods by repurposing Gaussian Splatting as an efficient universal view transformer that bridges the view disparity gap, mapping both image pixels and radar points into a common Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation. Our main contribution is GaussianCaR, an end-to-end network for BEV segmentation that, unlike prior BEV fusion methods, leverages Gaussian Splatting to map raw sensor information into latent features for efficient camera-radar fusion. Our architecture combines multi-scale fusion with a transformer decoder to efficiently extract BEV features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance on par with, or even surpassing, the state of the art on BEV segmentation tasks (57.3%, 82.9%, and 50.1% IoU for vehicles, roads, and lane dividers) on the nuScenes dataset, while maintaining a 3.2x faster inference runtime.

  Navigating socially in human environments requires more than satisfying geometric constraints, as collision-free paths may still interfere with ongoing activities or conflict with social norms. Addressing this challenge calls for analyzing interactions between agents and incorporating common-sense reasoning into planning. This paper presents a social robot navigation framework that integrates geometric planning with contextual social reasoning. The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts. Experiments in four social navigation contexts demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance with the lowest personal space violation duration, the minimal pedestrian-facing time, and no social zone intrusions.

  Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in complex missions that demand reliable autonomous navigation and robust obstacle avoidance. However, traditional modular pipelines often incur cumulative latency, whereas purely reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically provide limited formal safety guarantees. To bridge this gap, we propose an end-to-end RL framework augmented with model-based safety mechanisms. We incorporate physical priors in both training and deployment. During training, we design a physics-informed reward structure that provides global navigational guidance.

  Prior art has proposed a secondary application for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) infrastructure for remote sensing of ground-based and maritime targets. Here, a passive radar receiver is deployed to detect uncooperative targets on Earth's surface by capturing ground-reflected satellite signals. This work demonstrates a hardware prototype of an L-band Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) satellite-based remote sensing receiver system mounted on an AMD Zynq radio frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC) platform. Two synchronized receiver channels are introduced for capturing the direct signal (DS) from the satellite and ground-reflected signal (GRS) returns from targets. These signals are processed on the ARM processor and field programmable gate array (FPGA) of the RFSoC to generate delay-Doppler maps of the ground-based targets. The performance is first validated in a loop-back configuration of the RFSoC. Next, the DS and GRS signals are emulated by the output from two ports of the Keysight Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) and interfaced with the RFSoC where the signals are subsequently processed to obtain the delay-Doppler maps. The performance is validated for different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Multi-finger robotic hand manipulation and grasping are challenging due to the high-dimensional action space and the difficulty of acquiring large-scale training data. Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Aerial manipulation requires force-aware capabilities to enable safe and effective grasping and physical interaction. Previous works often rely on heavy, expensive force sensors unsuitable for typical quadrotor platforms, or perform grasping without force feedback, risking damage to fragile objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel force-aware grasping framework incorporating six low-cost, sensitive skin-like tactile sensors. We introduce a magnetic-based tactile sensing module that provides high-precision three-dimensional force measurements. We eliminate geomagnetic interference through a reference Hall sensor and simplify the calibration process compared to previous work. The proposed framework enables precise force-aware grasping control, allowing safe manipulation of fragile objects and real-time weight measurement of grasped items. The system is validated through comprehensive real-world experiments, including balloon grasping, dynamic load variation tests, and ablation studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in various aerial manipulation scenarios. Our approach achieves fully onboard operation without external motion capture systems, significantly enhancing the practicality of force-sensitive aerial manipulation.

  While imitation learning (IL) has achieved impressive success in dexterous manipulation through generative modeling and pretraining, state-of-the-art approaches like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models still struggle with adaptation to environmental changes and skill transfer. We argue this stems from mimicking raw trajectories without understanding the underlying intent. To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process. Experiments on several manipulation benchmarks and on a real robot demonstrate state-of-the-art success rates, superior inference efficiency, robust generalization against disturbances, and effective one-shot transfer.

  Teleoperation inherently relies on the human operator acting as a closed-loop controller to actively compensate for hardware imperfections, including latency, mechanical friction, and lack of explicit force feedback. Standard Behavior Cloning (BC), by mimicking the robot's executed trajectory, fundamentally ignores this compensatory mechanism. In this work, we propose a Dual-State Conditioning framework that shifts the learning objective to "Intent Cloning" (master command). We posit that the Intent-Execution Mismatch, the discrepancy between master command and slave response, is not noise, but a critical signal that physically encodes implicit interaction forces and algorithmically reveals the operator's strategy for overcoming system dynamics. By predicting the master intent, our policy learns to generate a "virtual equilibrium point", effectively realizing implicit impedance control. Furthermore, by explicitly conditioning on the history of this mismatch, the model performs implicit system identification, perceiving tracking errors as external forces to close the control loop. To bridge the temporal gap caused by inference latency, we further formulate the policy as a trajectory inpainter to ensure continuous control. We validate our approach on a sensorless, low-cost bi-manual setup. Empirical results across tasks requiring contact-rich manipulation and dynamic tracking reveal a decisive gap: while standard execution-cloning fails due to the inability to overcome contact stiffness and tracking lag, our mismatch-aware approach achieves robust success. This presents a minimalist behavior cloning framework for low-cost hardware, enabling force perception and dynamic compensation without relying on explicit force sensing.

  Despite strong generalization capabilities, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain constrained by the high cost of expert demonstrations and insufficient real-world interaction. While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced. Project page: https://cap-policy.github.io/

  We consider how model-based solvers can be leveraged to guide training of a universal policy to control from any feasible start state to any feasible goal in a contact-rich manipulation setting. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its strength in such settings, it may struggle to sufficiently explore and discover complex manipulation strategies, especially in sparse-reward settings. Our approach is based on the idea of a lower-dimensional manifold of feasible, likely-visited states during such manipulation and to guide RL with a sampler from this manifold. We propose Sample-Guided RL, which uses model-based constraint solvers to efficiently sample feasible configurations (satisfying differentiable collision, contact, and force constraints) and leverage them to guide RL for universal (goal-conditioned) manipulation policies. We study using this data directly to bias state visitation, as well as using black-box optimization of open-loop trajectories between random configurations to impose a state bias and optionally add a behavior cloning loss. In a minimalistic double sphere manipulation setting, Sample-Guided RL discovers complex manipulation strategies and achieves high success rates in reaching any statically stable state. In a more challenging panda arm setting, our approach achieves a significant success rate over a near-zero baseline, and demonstrates a breadth of complex whole-body-contact manipulation strategies.

  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) radiotherapy (RT), but practical constraints, such as patient discomfort, long scan times, and high costs often lead to incomplete modalities in clinical practice, compromising RT planning accuracy. Traditional MRI synthesis methods are modality-specific, limited in anatomical adaptability, and lack clinical interpretability-failing to meet NPC's RT needs. Here, we developed a unified foundation model integrating contrastive visual representation learning and vision-language alignment (VLA) to enable any-to-all MRI synthesis. The model uses a contrastive encoder for modality-invariant representations and a CLIP-based text-informed decoder for semantically consistent synthesis, supporting any-to-all MRI synthesis via one unified foundation model. Trained on 40,825 images from 13 institutions, it achieves consistently high performance (average SSIM 0.90, PSNR 27) across 26 internal/external validation sites (15,748 images), with superior synthesis fidelity and robustness to noise and domain shifts. Meanwhile, its unified representation enhances downstream RT-relevant tasks (e.g., segmentation). This work advances digital medicine solutions for NPC care by leveraging foundation models to bridge technical synthesis and clinical utility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Photorealistic color retouching plays a vital role in visual content creation, yet manual retouching remains inaccessible to non-experts due to its reliance on specialized expertise. Reference-based methods offer a promising alternative by transferring the preset color of a reference image to a source image. However, these approaches often operate as novice learners, performing global color mappings derived from pixel-level statistics, without a true understanding of semantic context or human aesthetics. To address this issue, we propose SemiNFT, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based retouching framework that mirrors the trajectory of human artistic training: beginning with rigid imitation and evolving into intuitive creation. Specifically, SemiNFT is first taught with paired triplets to acquire basic structural preservation and color mapping skills, and then advanced to reinforcement learning (RL) on unpaired data to cultivate nuanced aesthetic perception. Crucially, during the RL stage, to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old skills, we design a hybrid online-offline reward mechanism that anchors aesthetic exploration with structural review. % experiments Extensive experiments show that SemiNFT not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard preset transfer benchmarks but also demonstrates remarkable intelligence in zero-shot tasks, such as black-and-white photo colorization and cross-domain (anime-to-photo) preset transfer. These results confirm that SemiNFT transcends simple statistical matching and achieves a sophisticated level of aesthetic comprehension.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on test-time scaling via parallel decoding (for example, 512 samples) to boost reasoning accuracy, but this incurs substantial compute. We introduce CoRefine, a confidence-guided self-refinement method that achieves competitive accuracy using a fraction of the tokens via a lightweight 211k-parameter Conv1D controller atop a frozen LLM. The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification. We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers.

We introduce CausalT5K, a diagnostic benchmark of over 5,000 cases across 10 domains that tests three critical capabilities: (1) detecting rung collapse, where models answer interventional queries with associational evidence; (2) resisting sycophantic drift under adversarial pressure; and (3) generating Wise Refusals that specify missing information when evidence is underdetermined. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, CausalT5K embeds causal traps in realistic narratives and decomposes performance into Utility (sensitivity) and Safety (specificity), revealing failure modes invisible to aggregate accuracy. Developed through a rigorous human-machine collaborative pipeline involving 40 domain experts, iterative cross-validation cycles, and composite verification via rule-based, LLM, and human scoring, CausalT5K implements Pearl's Ladder of Causation as research infrastructure. Preliminary experiments reveal a Four-Quadrant Control Landscape where static audit policies universally fail, a finding that demonstrates CausalT5K's value for advancing trustworthy reasoning systems.

  Videos from fleets of ground robots can advance public safety by providing scalable situational awareness and reducing professionals' burden. Yet little is known about how to design and integrate multi-robot videos into public safety workflows. Collaborating with six police agencies, we examined how such videos could be made practical. In Study 1, we presented the first testbed for multi-robot ground video sensemaking. The testbed includes 38 events-of-interest (EoI) relevant to public safety, a dataset of 20 robot patrol videos (10 day/night pairs) covering EoI types, and 6 design requirements aimed at improving current video sensemaking practices. In Study 2, we built MRVS, a tool that augments multi-robot patrol video streams with a prompt-engineered video understanding model. Participants reported reduced manual workload and greater confidence with LLM-based explanations, while noting concerns about false alarms and privacy. We conclude with implications for designing future multi-robot video sensemaking tools. The testbed is available at https://github.com/Puqi7/MRVS\_VideoSensemaking

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is an emerging area, yet a persistent challenge remains: MLLMs rely on coarse time-series heuristics but struggle with multi-dimensional, detailed reasoning, which is vital for understanding complex time-series data. We present AnomSeer to address this by reinforcing the model to ground its reasoning in precise, structural details of time series, unifying anomaly classification, localization, and explanation. At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms). Building on this, we propose a novel time-series grounded policy optimization (TimerPO) that incorporates two additional components beyond standard reinforcement learning: a time-series grounded advantage based on optimal transport and an orthogonal projection to ensure this auxiliary granular signal does not interfere with the primary detection objective. Across diverse anomaly scenarios, AnomSeer, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct, outperforms larger commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o) in classification and localization accuracy, particularly on point- and frequency-driven exceptions. Moreover, it produces plausible time-series reasoning traces that support its conclusions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  The growing capability of video generation poses escalating security risks, making reliable detection increasingly essential. In this paper, we introduce VideoVeritas, a framework that integrates fine-grained perception and fact-based reasoning. We observe that while current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capacity, their granular perception ability remains limited. To mitigate this, we introduce Joint Preference Alignment and Perception Pretext Reinforcement Learning (PPRL). Specifically, rather than directly optimizing for detection task, we adopt general spatiotemporal grounding and self-supervised object counting in the RL stage, enhancing detection performance with simple perception pretext tasks. To facilitate robust evaluation, we further introduce MintVid, a light yet high-quality dataset containing 3K videos from 9 state-of-the-art generators, along with a real-world collected subset that has factual errors in content. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods tend to bias towards either superficial reasoning or mechanical analysis, while VideoVeritas achieves more balanced performance across diverse benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly large language models (LLMs), demonstrate powerful inference capabilities but consume substantial energy. Conversely, spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency due to their binary and event-driven characteristics, thus motivating the study of ANN-to-SNN conversion. In this process, quantization plays a pivotal role, mapping LLMs' floating-point parameters to discrete SNN parameters via the temporal dimension of the time window. However, several challenges remain in the conversion process: (i) converting high bit-width quantization values into binary spikes requires longer time windows, increasing system latency; and (ii) the inherent trade-off between the information loss of single-spike schemes and the energy costs of multi-spike ones in SNN. To address these challenges, we propose Kirin, a integer and spike hybrid based SNN to achieve accuracy lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion with time and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first propose a Spike Matrix Hybridization strategy that encoding low bit-width parameters that leading to small time window size into binary spikes while preserving the rest in integer format, thereby reducing the overall latency of SNN execution. Second, we introduce a silence threshold mechanism to regulate the timing of single-spike firing, ensuring the output is mathematically equivalent to the LLM's output and preserves accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Kirin, under a W4A4\&8 quantization setting, achieves near-FP16 accuracy while reducing energy consumption by up to 84.66\% and shortening time steps by 93.75\%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Generating step-by-step "how-to" procedures is a key LLM capability: how-to advice is commonly requested in chatbots, and step-by-step planning is critical for reasoning over complex tasks. Yet, measuring and improving procedural validity at scale on real-world tasks remains challenging and understudied. To address this, we introduce How2Everything, a scalable framework to evaluate and improve goal-conditioned procedure generation. Our framework includes How2Mine, which mines 351K procedures from 980K web pages across 14 topics and readily scales to larger corpora. From this pool we build How2Bench, a 7K-example evaluation set balanced across topics. To reliably score model outputs, we develop How2Score, an evaluation protocol that uses an LLM judge to detect whether a generation contains any critical failure that would prevent achieving the goal. For low-cost, reproducible evaluation, we distill a frontier model into an open 8B model, achieving 80.5% agreement with human annotators. How2Bench reveals clear scaling trends across model sizes and training stages, providing signal early in pretraining. Finally, RL using How2Score as a reward improves performance on How2Bench by >10 points across three models without systematic regressions on standard benchmarks, with gains robust to superficial source-document memorization or format compliance. Taken together, How2Everything shows how pretraining web data can support a closed loop of capability evaluation and improvement at scale.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Root cause localization remain challenging in complex and large-scale microservice architectures. The complex fault propagation among microservices and the high dimensionality of telemetry data, including metrics, logs, and traces, limit the effectiveness of existing root cause analysis (RCA) methods. In this paper, a residual-connection-based RCA method using large language model (LLM), named RC-LLM, is proposed. A residual-like hierarchical fusion structure is designed to integrate multi-source telemetry data, while the contextual reasoning capability of large language models is leveraged to model temporal and cross-microservice causal dependencies. Experimental results on CCF-AIOps microservice datasets demonstrate that RC-LLM achieves strong accuracy and efficiency in root cause analysis.

  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in domains requiring sequential decision-making, motivating its application to cybersecurity problems. However, transitioning DRL from laboratory simulations to bespoke cyber environments can introduce numerous issues. This is further exacerbated by the often adversarial, non-stationary, and partially-observable nature of most cybersecurity tasks. In this paper, we identify and systematize 11 methodological pitfalls that frequently occur in DRL for cybersecurity (DRL4Sec) literature across the stages of environment modeling, agent training, performance evaluation, and system deployment. By analyzing 66 significant DRL4Sec papers (2018-2025), we quantify the prevalence of each pitfall and find an average of over five pitfalls per paper. We demonstrate the practical impact of these pitfalls using controlled experiments in (i) autonomous cyber defense, (ii) adversarial malware creation, and (iii) web security testing environments. Finally, we provide actionable recommendations for each pitfall to support the development of more rigorous and deployable DRL-based security systems.

  Video generation is rapidly evolving towards unified audio-video generation. In this paper, we present ALIVE, a generation model that adapts a pretrained Text-to-Video (T2V) model to Sora-style audio-video generation and animation. In particular, the model unlocks the Text-to-Video&Audio (T2VA) and Reference-to-Video&Audio (animation) capabilities compared to the T2V foundation models. To support the audio-visual synchronization and reference animation, we augment the popular MMDiT architecture with a joint audio-video branch which includes TA-CrossAttn for temporally-aligned cross-modal fusion and UniTemp-RoPE for precise audio-visual alignment. Meanwhile, a comprehensive data pipeline consisting of audio-video captioning, quality control, etc., is carefully designed to collect high-quality finetuning data. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to perform a comprehensive model test and comparison. After continue pretraining and finetuning on million-level high-quality data, ALIVE demonstrates outstanding performance, consistently outperforming open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. With detailed recipes and benchmarks, we hope ALIVE helps the community develop audio-video generation models more efficiently. Official page: https://github.com/FoundationVision/Alive.

  Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) promises the recovery of optimal policies from static datasets, yet it remains susceptible to the overestimation of out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, particularly in fractured and sparse data manifolds.Current solutions necessitates a trade off between computational efficiency and performance. Methods like CQL offers rigorous conservatism but require tremendous compute power while efficient expectile-based methods like IQL often fail to correct OOD errors on pathological datasets, collapsing to Behavioural Cloning. In this work, we propose Geometric Pessimism, a modular, compute-efficient framework that augments standard IQL with density-based penalty derived from k-nearest-neighbour distances in the state-action embedding space. By pre-computing the penalties applied to each state-action pair our method injects OOD conservatism via reward shaping with a O(1) training overhead. Evaluated on the D4Rl MuJoCo benchmark, our method, Geo-IQL outperforms standard IQL on sensitive and unstable medium-replay tasks by over 18 points, while reducing inter-seed variance by 4x. Furthermore, Geo-IQL does not degrade performance on stable manifolds. Crucially, we validate our algorithm on the MIMIC-III Sepsis critical care dataset. While standard IQL collapses to behaviour cloning, Geo-IQL demonstrates active policy improvement. Maintaining safety constraints, achieving 86.4% terminal agreement with clinicians compared to IQL's 75%. Our results suggest that geometric pessimism provides the necessary regularisation to safely overcome local optima in critical, real-world decision systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from a fixed dataset while maximizing performance under cumulative cost constraints. In practice, deployment requirements often vary across scenarios, necessitating a single policy that can adapt zero-shot to different cost thresholds. However, most existing offline safe RL methods are trained under a pre-specified threshold, yielding policies with limited generalization and deployment flexibility across cost thresholds. Motivated by recent progress in conditional sequence modeling (CSM), which enables flexible goal-conditioned control by specifying target returns, we propose RCDT, a CSM-based method that supports zero-shot deployment across multiple cost thresholds within a single trained policy. RCDT is the first CSM-based offline safe RL algorithm that integrates a Lagrangian-style cost penalty with an auto-adaptive penalty coefficient. To avoid overly conservative behavior and achieve a more favorable return--cost trade-off, a reward--cost-aware trajectory reweighting mechanism and Q-value regularization are further incorporated. Extensive experiments on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that RCDT consistently improves return--cost trade-offs over representative baselines, advancing the state-of-the-art in offline safe RL.

  According to the United Nations, wildfire frequency and intensity are projected to increase by approximately 14% by 2030 and 30% by 2050 due to global warming, posing critical threats to life, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Conventional disaster management frameworks rely on static simulations and passive data acquisition, hindering their ability to adapt to arbitrarily evolving wildfire episodes in real-time. To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining. Our results indicate marked reductions in detection-to-intervention latency and more effective resource coordination versus traditional systems. By uniting real-time bidirectional DTs with agentic AI, IVSR offers a scalable, semi-automated decision-support paradigm for proactive, adaptive wildfire disaster management.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Function offloading is a promising solution to address limitations concerning computational capacity and available energy of Connected Automated Vehicles~(CAVs) or other autonomous robots by distributing computational tasks between local and remote computing devices in form of distributed services. This paper presents a generic function offloading framework that can be used to offload an arbitrary set of computational tasks with a focus on autonomous driving. To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV. We apply the proposed framework on the use case of service-oriented trajectory planning, where we offload the trajectory planning task of CAVs to a Multi-Access Edge Computing~(MEC) server. The evaluation is conducted in both simulation and real-world application. It demonstrates the potential of the function offloading framework to guarantee the QoS for trajectory planning while improving the computational efficiency of the CAVs. Moreover, the simulation results also show the adaptability of the framework to diverse scenarios involving simultaneous offloading requests from multiple CAVs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  The integration of service-oriented architectures (SOA) with function offloading for distributed, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) offers the opportunity for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to extend their locally available services. One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work. The evaluation compares the performance of the extended framework considering computational complexity, with energy savings being a major motivation for function offloading, and its capability to detect data from corrupted remote services.

  Robust and accurate perception of dynamic objects and map elements is crucial for autonomous vehicles performing safe navigation in complex traffic scenarios. While vision-only methods have become the de facto standard due to their technical advances, they can benefit from effective and cost-efficient fusion with radar measurements. In this work, we advance fusion methods by repurposing Gaussian Splatting as an efficient universal view transformer that bridges the view disparity gap, mapping both image pixels and radar points into a common Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation. Our main contribution is GaussianCaR, an end-to-end network for BEV segmentation that, unlike prior BEV fusion methods, leverages Gaussian Splatting to map raw sensor information into latent features for efficient camera-radar fusion. Our architecture combines multi-scale fusion with a transformer decoder to efficiently extract BEV features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance on par with, or even surpassing, the state of the art on BEV segmentation tasks (57.3%, 82.9%, and 50.1% IoU for vehicles, roads, and lane dividers) on the nuScenes dataset, while maintaining a 3.2x faster inference runtime.

  Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in complex missions that demand reliable autonomous navigation and robust obstacle avoidance. However, traditional modular pipelines often incur cumulative latency, whereas purely reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically provide limited formal safety guarantees. To bridge this gap, we propose an end-to-end RL framework augmented with model-based safety mechanisms. We incorporate physical priors in both training and deployment. During training, we design a physics-informed reward structure that provides global navigational guidance. During deployment, we integrate a real-time safety filter that projects the policy outputs onto a provably safe set to enforce strict collision-avoidance constraints. This hybrid architecture reconciles high-speed flight with robust safety assurances. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms both traditional planners and recent end-to-end obstacle avoidance approaches based on differentiable physics. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization, enabling reliable high-speed navigation in dense clutter and challenging outdoor forest environments at velocities up to 7.5m/s.

  Uncertainty calibration in pre-trained transformers is critical for their reliable deployment in risk-sensitive applications. Yet, most existing pre-trained transformers do not have a principled mechanism for uncertainty propagation through their feature transformation stack. In this work, we propose a diffusion-inspired reconfiguration of transformers in which each feature transformation block is modeled as a probabilistic mapping. Composing these probabilistic mappings reveals a probability path that mimics the structure of a diffusion process, transporting data mass from the input distribution to the pre-trained feature distribution. This probability path can then be recompiled on a diffusion process with a unified transition model to enable principled propagation of representation uncertainty throughout the pre-trained model's architecture while maintaining its original predictive performance. Empirical results across a variety of vision and language benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior calibration and predictive accuracy compared to existing uncertainty-aware transformers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Aerial manipulation requires force-aware capabilities to enable safe and effective grasping and physical interaction. Previous works often rely on heavy, expensive force sensors unsuitable for typical quadrotor platforms, or perform grasping without force feedback, risking damage to fragile objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel force-aware grasping framework incorporating six low-cost, sensitive skin-like tactile sensors. We introduce a magnetic-based tactile sensing module that provides high-precision three-dimensional force measurements. We eliminate geomagnetic interference through a reference Hall sensor and simplify the calibration process compared to previous work. The proposed framework enables precise force-aware grasping control, allowing safe manipulation of fragile objects and real-time weight measurement of grasped items. The system is validated through comprehensive real-world experiments, including balloon grasping, dynamic load variation tests, and ablation studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in various aerial manipulation scenarios. Our approach achieves fully onboard operation without external motion capture systems, significantly enhancing the practicality of force-sensitive aerial manipulation.

  Out of distribution (OOD) robustness in autonomous driving is often reduced to a single number, hiding what breaks a policy. We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\rightarrow$ urban and day $\rightarrow$ night ($\sim 31\%$ each); actor swaps $\sim 10\%$, moderate rain $\sim 7\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\% \rightarrow 70.1\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Despite strong generalization capabilities, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain constrained by the high cost of expert demonstrations and insufficient real-world interaction. While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks.

  World Models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning compact, predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling agents to reason, plan, and generalize beyond direct experience. Despite recent interest in World Models, most available implementations remain publication-specific, severely limiting their reusability, increasing the risk of bugs, and reducing evaluation standardization. To mitigate these issues, we introduce stable-worldmodel (SWM), a modular, tested, and documented world-model research ecosystem that provides efficient data-collection tools, standardized environments, planning algorithms, and baseline implementations. In addition, each environment in SWM enables controllable factors of variation, including visual and physical properties, to support robustness and continual learning research. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of SWM by using it to study zero-shot robustness in DINO-WM.

  Accurately predicting pedestrian motion is crucial for safe and reliable autonomous driving in complex urban environments. In this work, we present a 3D vehicle-conditioned pedestrian pose forecasting framework that explicitly incorporates surrounding vehicle information. To support this, we enhance the Waymo-3DSkelMo dataset with aligned 3D vehicle bounding boxes, enabling realistic modeling of multi-agent pedestrian-vehicle interactions. We introduce a sampling scheme to categorize scenes by pedestrian and vehicle count, facilitating training across varying interaction complexities. Our proposed network adapts the TBIFormer architecture with a dedicated vehicle encoder and pedestrian-vehicle interaction cross-attention module to fuse pedestrian and vehicle features, allowing predictions to be conditioned on both historical pedestrian motion and surrounding vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy and validate different approaches for modeling pedestrian-vehicle interactions, highlighting the importance of vehicle-aware 3D pose prediction for autonomous driving.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Selecting interpretable feature sets in underdetermined ($n \ll p$) and highly correlated regimes constitutes a fundamental challenge in data science, particularly when analyzing physical measurements. In such settings, multiple distinct sparse subsets may explain the response equally well. Identifying these alternatives is crucial for generating domain-specific insights into the underlying mechanisms, yet conventional methods typically isolate a single solution, obscuring the full spectrum of plausible explanations. We present GEMSS (Gaussian Ensemble for Multiple Sparse Solutions), a variational Bayesian framework specifically designed to simultaneously discover multiple, diverse sparse feature combinations. The method employs a structured spike-and-slab prior for sparsity, a mixture of Gaussians to approximate the intractable multimodal posterior, and a Jaccard-based penalty to further control solution diversity. Unlike sequential greedy approaches, GEMSS optimizes the entire ensemble of solutions within a single objective function via stochastic gradient descent. The method is validated on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 128 synthetic experiments across classification and regression tasks. Results demonstrate that GEMSS scales effectively to high-dimensional settings ($p=5000$) with sample size as small as $n = 50$, generalizes seamlessly to continuous targets, handles missing data natively, and exhibits remarkable robustness to class imbalance and Gaussian noise. GEMSS is available as a Python package 'gemss' at PyPI. The full GitHub repository at https://github.com/kat-er-ina/gemss/ also includes a free, easy-to-use application suitable for non-coders.

  Videos from fleets of ground robots can advance public safety by providing scalable situational awareness and reducing professionals' burden. Yet little is known about how to design and integrate multi-robot videos into public safety workflows. Collaborating with six police agencies, we examined how such videos could be made practical. In Study 1, we presented the first testbed for multi-robot ground video sensemaking. The testbed includes 38 events-of-interest (EoI) relevant to public safety, a dataset of 20 robot patrol videos (10 day/night pairs) covering EoI types, and 6 design requirements aimed at improving current video sensemaking practices. In Study 2, we built MRVS, a tool that augments multi-robot patrol video streams with a prompt-engineered video understanding model. Participants reported reduced manual workload and greater confidence with LLM-based explanations, while noting concerns about false alarms and privacy. We conclude with implications for designing future multi-robot video sensemaking tools. The testbed is available at https://github.com/Puqi7/MRVS\_VideoSensemaking

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is an emerging area, yet a persistent challenge remains: MLLMs rely on coarse time-series heuristics but struggle with multi-dimensional, detailed reasoning, which is vital for understanding complex time-series data. We present AnomSeer to address this by reinforcing the model to ground its reasoning in precise, structural details of time series, unifying anomaly classification, localization, and explanation. At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms). Building on this, we propose a novel time-series grounded policy optimization (TimerPO) that incorporates two additional components beyond standard reinforcement learning: a time-series grounded advantage based on optimal transport and an orthogonal projection to ensure this auxiliary granular signal does not interfere with the primary detection objective. Across diverse anomaly scenarios, AnomSeer, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct, outperforms larger commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o) in classification and localization accuracy, particularly on point- and frequency-driven exceptions. Moreover, it produces plausible time-series reasoning traces that support its conclusions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) radiotherapy (RT), but practical constraints, such as patient discomfort, long scan times, and high costs often lead to incomplete modalities in clinical practice, compromising RT planning accuracy. Traditional MRI synthesis methods are modality-specific, limited in anatomical adaptability, and lack clinical interpretability-failing to meet NPC's RT needs. Here, we developed a unified foundation model integrating contrastive visual representation learning and vision-language alignment (VLA) to enable any-to-all MRI synthesis. The model uses a contrastive encoder for modality-invariant representations and a CLIP-based text-informed decoder for semantically consistent synthesis, supporting any-to-all MRI synthesis via one unified foundation model. Trained on 40,825 images from 13 institutions, it achieves consistently high performance (average SSIM 0.90, PSNR 27) across 26 internal/external validation sites (15,748 images), with superior synthesis fidelity and robustness to noise and domain shifts. Meanwhile, its unified representation enhances downstream RT-relevant tasks (e.g., segmentation). This work advances digital medicine solutions for NPC care by leveraging foundation models to bridge technical synthesis and clinical utility.

- **Multi-Staged Framework for Safety Analysis of Offloaded Services in Distributed Intelligent Transportation Systems**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  The integration of service-oriented architectures (SOA) with function offloading for distributed, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) offers the opportunity for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to extend their locally available services. One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work. The evaluation compares the performance of the extended framework considering computational complexity, with energy savings being a major motivation for function offloading, and its capability to detect data from corrupted remote services.

  The study of eye movements, particularly saccades and fixations, are fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of human cognition and perception. Accurate classification of these movements requires sensing technologies capable of capturing rapid dynamics without distortion. Event cameras, also known as Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), provide asynchronous recordings of changes in light intensity, thereby eliminating motion blur inherent in conventional frame-based cameras and offering superior temporal resolution and data efficiency. In this study, we introduce a synthetic dataset generated with Blender to simulate saccades and fixations under controlled conditions. Leveraging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), we evaluate its robustness by training two architectures and finetuning on real event data. The proposed models achieve up to 0.83 accuracy and maintain consistent performance across varying temporal resolutions, demonstrating stability in eye movement classification. Moreover, the use of SNNs with synthetic event streams yields substantial computational efficiency gains over artificial neural network (ANN) counterparts, underscoring the utility of synthetic data augmentation in advancing event-based vision.

  Do language models make decisions under uncertainty like humans do, and what role does chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning play in the underlying decision process? We introduce an active probabilistic reasoning task that cleanly separates sampling (actively acquiring evidence) from inference (integrating evidence toward a decision). Benchmarking humans and a broad set of contemporary large language models against near-optimal reference policies reveals a consistent pattern: extended reasoning is the key determinant of strong performance, driving large gains in inference and producing belief trajectories that become strikingly human-like, while yielding only modest improvements in active sampling. To explain these differences, we fit a mechanistic model that captures systematic deviations from optimal behavior via four interpretable latent variables: memory, strategy, choice bias, and occlusion awareness. This model places humans and models in a shared low-dimensional cognitive space, reproduces behavioral signatures across agents, and shows how chain-of-thought shifts language models toward human-like regimes of evidence accumulation and belief-to-choice mapping, tightening alignment in inference while leaving a persistent gap in information acquisition.

  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in domains requiring sequential decision-making, motivating its application to cybersecurity problems. However, transitioning DRL from laboratory simulations to bespoke cyber environments can introduce numerous issues. This is further exacerbated by the often adversarial, non-stationary, and partially-observable nature of most cybersecurity tasks. In this paper, we identify and systematize 11 methodological pitfalls that frequently occur in DRL for cybersecurity (DRL4Sec) literature across the stages of environment modeling, agent training, performance evaluation, and system deployment. By analyzing 66 significant DRL4Sec papers (2018-2025), we quantify the prevalence of each pitfall and find an average of over five pitfalls per paper. We demonstrate the practical impact of these pitfalls using controlled experiments in (i) autonomous cyber defense, (ii) adversarial malware creation, and (iii) web security testing environments. Finally, we provide actionable recommendations for each pitfall to support the development of more rigorous and deployable DRL-based security systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Generalist humanoid motion trackers have recently achieved strong simulation metrics by scaling data and training, yet often remain brittle on hardware during sustained teleoperation due to interface- and dynamics-induced errors. We present MOSAIC, an open-source, full-stack system for humanoid motion tracking and whole-body teleoperation across multiple interfaces. MOSAIC first learns a teleoperation-oriented general motion tracker via RL on a multi-source motion bank with adaptive resampling and rewards that emphasize world-frame motion consistency, which is critical for mobile teleoperation. To bridge the sim-to-real interface gap without sacrificing generality, MOSAIC then performs rapid residual adaptation: an interface-specific policy is trained using minimal interface-specific data, and then distilled into the general tracker through an additive residual module, outperforming naive fine-tuning or continual learning. We validate MOSAIC with systematic ablations, out-of-distribution benchmarking, and real-robot experiments demonstrating robust offline motion replay and online long-horizon teleoperation under realistic latency and noise.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Vision-language pretrained models offer strong transferable representations, yet adapting them in privacy-sensitive multi-party settings is challenging due to the high communication cost of federated optimization and the limited local data on clients. Federated prompt learning mitigates this issue by keeping the VLPM backbone frozen and collaboratively training lightweight prompt parameters. However, existing approaches typically enforce a unified prompt structure and length across clients, which is inadequate under practical client heterogeneity in both data distributions and system resources, and may further introduce conflicts between globally shared and locally optimal knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{SDFed}, a heterogeneous federated prompt learning framework that bridges Local-Global Discrepancy via Subspace Refinement and Divergence Control. SDFed maintains a fixed-length global prompt for efficient aggregation while allowing each client to learn a variable-length local prompt to better match its data characteristics and capacity. To mitigate local-global conflicts and facilitate effective knowledge transfer, SDFed introduces a subspace refinement method for local prompts and an information retention and divergence control strategy that preserves key local information while maintaining appropriate separability between global and local representations. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SDFed consistently improves performance and robustness in heterogeneous federated settings.

  Robust and accurate perception of dynamic objects and map elements is crucial for autonomous vehicles performing safe navigation in complex traffic scenarios. While vision-only methods have become the de facto standard due to their technical advances, they can benefit from effective and cost-efficient fusion with radar measurements. In this work, we advance fusion methods by repurposing Gaussian Splatting as an efficient universal view transformer that bridges the view disparity gap, mapping both image pixels and radar points into a common Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation. Our main contribution is GaussianCaR, an end-to-end network for BEV segmentation that, unlike prior BEV fusion methods, leverages Gaussian Splatting to map raw sensor information into latent features for efficient camera-radar fusion. Our architecture combines multi-scale fusion with a transformer decoder to efficiently extract BEV features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance on par with, or even surpassing, the state of the art on BEV segmentation tasks (57.3%, 82.9%, and 50.1% IoU for vehicles, roads, and lane dividers) on the nuScenes dataset, while maintaining a 3.2x faster inference runtime. Code and project page are available online.
