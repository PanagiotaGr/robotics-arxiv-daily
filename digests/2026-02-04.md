  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We present HetroD, a dataset and benchmark for developing autonomous driving systems in heterogeneous environments. HetroD targets the critical challenge of navi- gating real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulner- able road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists that interact with vehicles. These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

  Sandeep Patil, Yongqi Dong, Haneen Farah, Hans Hellendoorn

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Lane detection is a crucial perception task for all levels of automated vehicles (AVs) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, particularly in mixed-traffic environments where AVs must interact with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and challenging traffic scenarios. Current methods lack versatility in delivering accurate, robust, and real-time compatible lane detection, especially vision-based methods often neglect critical regions of the image and their spatial-temporal (ST) salience, leading to poor performance in difficult circumstances such as serious occlusion and dazzle lighting. This study introduces a novel sequential neural network model with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on key features of lane lines and exploit salient ST correlations among continuous image frames. The proposed model, built on a standard encoder-decoder structure and common neural network backbones, is trained and evaluated on three large-scale open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength and robustness of the proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various testing scenarios. Furthermore, with the ST attention mechanism, the developed sequential neural network models exhibit fewer parameters and reduced Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to baseline sequential models, highlighting their computational efficiency. Relevant data, code, and models are released at https://doi.org/10.4121/4619cab6-ae4a-40d5-af77-582a77f3d821.

- **Multi-Player, Multi-Strategy Quantum Game Model for Interaction-Aware Decision-Making in Autonomous Driving**  
  Karim Essalmi, Fernando Garrido, Fawzi Nashashibi  
  _2026-02-03_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03571v1 · `cs.RO`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Although significant progress has been made in decision-making for automated driving, challenges remain for deployment in the real world. One challenge lies in addressing interaction-awareness. Most existing approaches oversimplify interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents, and often neglect interactions among the agents themselves. A common solution is to model these interactions using classical game theory. However, its formulation assumes rational players, whereas human behavior is frequently uncertain or irrational. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum Game Decision-Making (QGDM) model, a novel framework that combines classical game theory with quantum mechanics principles (such as superposition, entanglement, and interference) to tackle multi-player, multi-strategy decision-making problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to apply quantum game theory to decision-making for automated driving. QGDM runs in real time on a standard computer, without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate QGDM in simulation across various scenarios, including roundabouts, merging, and highways, and compare its performance with multiple baseline methods. Results show that QGDM significantly improves success rates and reduces collision rates compared to classical approaches, particularly in scenarios with high interaction.

- **Inlier-Centric Post-Training Quantization for Object Detection Models**  
  Minsu Kim, Dongyeun Lee, Jaemyung Yu, Jiwan Hur, Giseop Kim, Junmo Kim  
  _2026-02-03_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03472v1 · `cs.CV`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Object detection is pivotal in computer vision, yet its immense computational demands make deployment slow and power-hungry, motivating quantization. However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples. Experiments on the COCO and nuScenes benchmarks show consistent reductions in quantization error for camera-based (2D and 3D) and LiDAR-based (3D) object detection.

- **Conformal Reachability for Safe Control in Unknown Environments**  
  Xinhang Ma, Junlin Wu, Yiannis Kantaros, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik  
  _2026-02-03_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03799v1 · `cs.RO`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Designing provably safe control is a core problem in trustworthy autonomy. However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward.

- **Digital-Twin Empowered Deep Reinforcement Learning For Site-Specific Radio Resource Management in NextG Wireless Aerial Corridor**  
  Pulok Tarafder, Zoheb Hassan, Imtiaz Ahmed, Danda B. Rawat, Kamrul Hasan, Cong Pu  
  _2026-02-03_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03801v1 · `eess.SP`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Joint base station (BS) association and beam selection in multi-UAV aerial corridors constitutes a challenging radio resource management (RRM) problem. It is driven by high-dimensional action spaces, need for substantial overhead to acquire global channel state information (CSI), rapidly varying propagation channels, and stringent latency requirements. Conventional combinatorial optimization methods, while near-optimal, are computationally prohibitive for real-time operation in such dynamic environments. While learning-based approaches can mitigate computational complexity and CSI overhead, the need for extensive site-specific (SS) datasets for model training remains a key challenge. To address these challenges, we develop a Digital Twin (DT)-enabled two-stage optimization framework that couples physics-based beam gain modeling with DRL for scalable online decision-making. In the first stage, a channel twin (CT) is constructed using a high-fidelity ray-tracing solver with geo-spatial contexts, and network information to capture SS propagation characteristics, and dual annealing algorithm is employed to precompute optimal transmission beam directions. In the second stage, a Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (MH-PPO) agent, equipped with a scalable multi-head actor-critic architecture, is trained on the DT-generated channel dataset to directly map complex channel and beam states to jointly execute UAV-BS-beam association decisions. The proposed PPO agent achieves a 44%-121% improvement over DQN and 249%-807% gain over traditional heuristic based optimization schemes in a dense UAV scenario, while reducing inference latency by several orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that DT-driven training pipelines can deliver high-performance, low-latency RRM policies tailored to SS deployments suitable for real-time resource management in next-generation aerial corridor networks.

- **Input-to-State Safe Backstepping: Robust Safety-Critical Control with Unmatched Uncertainties**  
  Max H. Cohen, Pio Ong, Aaron D. Ames  
  _2026-02-03_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03691v1 · `eess.SY`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Guaranteeing safety in the presence of unmatched disturbances -- uncertainties that cannot be directly canceled by the control input -- remains a key challenge in nonlinear control. This paper presents a constructive approach to safety-critical control of nonlinear systems with unmatched disturbances. We first present a generalization of the input-to-state safety (ISSf) framework for systems with these uncertainties using the recently developed notion of an Optimal Decay CBF, which provides more flexibility for satisfying the associated Lyapunov-like conditions for safety. From there, we outline a procedure for constructing ISSf-CBFs for two relevant classes of systems with unmatched uncertainties: i) strict-feedback systems; ii) dual-relative-degree systems, which are similar to differentially flat systems. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations of an inverted pendulum and planar quadrotor.

- **FullStack-Agent: Enhancing Agentic Full-Stack Web Coding via Development-Oriented Testing and Repository Back-Translation**  
  Zimu Lu, Houxing Ren, Yunqiao Yang, Ke Wang, Zhuofan Zong, Mingjie Zhan, Hongsheng Li

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Assisting non-expert users to develop complex interactive websites has become a popular task for LLM-powered code agents. However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The code is released at https://github.com/mnluzimu/FullStack-Agent.

- **A Scene Graph Backed Approach to Open Set Semantic Mapping**  
  Martin Günther, Felix Igelbrink, Oscar Lima, Lennart Niecksch, Marian Renz, Martin Atzmueller  
  _2026-02-03_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03781v1 · `cs.RO`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  While Open Set Semantic Mapping and 3D Semantic Scene Graphs (3DSSGs) are established paradigms in robotic perception, deploying them effectively to support high-level reasoning in large-scale, real-world environments remains a significant challenge. Most existing approaches decouple perception from representation, treating the scene graph as a derivative layer generated post hoc. This limits both consistency and scalability. In contrast, we propose a mapping architecture where the 3DSSG serves as the foundational backend, acting as the primary knowledge representation for the entire mapping process. Our approach leverages prior work on incremental scene graph prediction to infer and update the graph structure in real-time as the environment is explored. This ensures that the map remains topologically consistent and computationally efficient, even during extended operations in large-scale settings. By maintaining an explicit, spatially grounded representation that supports both flat and hierarchical topologies, we bridge the gap between sub-symbolic raw sensor data and high-level symbolic reasoning. Consequently, this provides a stable, verifiable structure that knowledge-driven frameworks, ranging from knowledge graphs and ontologies to Large Language Models (LLMs), can directly exploit, enabling agents to operate with enhanced interpretability, trustworthiness, and alignment to human concepts.

- **CMR: Contractive Mapping Embeddings for Robust Humanoid Locomotion on Unstructured Terrains**  
  Qixin Zeng, Hongyin Zhang, Shangke Lyu, Junxi Jin, Donglin Wang, Chao Huang

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Robust disturbance rejection remains a longstanding challenge in humanoid locomotion, particularly on unstructured terrains where sensing is unreliable and model mismatch is pronounced. While perception information, such as height map, enhances terrain awareness, sensor noise and sim-to-real gaps can destabilize policies in practice. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis that bounds the return gap under observation noise, when the induced latent dynamics are contractive. Furthermore, we present Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework that maps high-dimensional, disturbance-prone observations into a latent space, where local perturbations are attenuated over time. Specifically, this approach couples contrastive representation learning with Lipschitz regularization to preserve task-relevant geometry while explicitly controlling sensitivity. Notably, the formulation can be incorporated into modern deep reinforcement learning pipelines as an auxiliary loss term with minimal additional technical effort required. Further, our extensive humanoid experiments show that CMR potently outperforms other locomotion algorithms under increased noise.

- **FOVI: A biologically-inspired foveated interface for deep vision models**  
  Nicholas M. Blauch, George A. Alvarez, Talia Konkle  
  _2026-02-03_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03766v1 · `cs.CV`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Human vision is foveated, with variable resolution peaking at the center of a large field of view; this reflects an efficient trade-off for active sensing, allowing eye-movements to bring different parts of the world into focus with other parts of the world in context. In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/nblauch/fovi and https://huggingface.co/fovi-pytorch.

- **Conditional Flow Matching for Visually-Guided Acoustic Highlighting**  
  Hugo Malard, Gael Le Lan, Daniel Wong, David Lou Alon, Yi-Chiao Wu, Sanjeel Parekh  
  _2026-02-03_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03762v1 · `eess.AS`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Visually-guided acoustic highlighting seeks to rebalance audio in alignment with the accompanying video, creating a coherent audio-visual experience. While visual saliency and enhancement have been widely studied, acoustic highlighting remains underexplored, often leading to misalignment between visual and auditory focus. Existing approaches use discriminative models, which struggle with the inherent ambiguity in audio remixing, where no natural one-to-one mapping exists between poorly-balanced and well-balanced audio mixes. To address this limitation, we reframe this task as a generative problem and introduce a Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) framework. A key challenge in iterative flow-based generation is that early prediction errors -- in selecting the correct source to enhance -- compound over steps and push trajectories off-manifold. To address this, we introduce a rollout loss that penalizes drift at the final step, encouraging self-correcting trajectories and stabilizing long-range flow integration. We further propose a conditioning module that fuses audio and visual cues before vector field regression, enabling explicit cross-modal source selection. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method consistently surpasses the previous state-of-the-art discriminative approach, establishing that visually-guided audio remixing is best addressed through generative modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Information retrieval has long focused on ranking documents by semantic relatedness. Yet many real-world information needs demand more: enforcement of logical constraints, multi-step inference, and synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence. Addressing these requirements is, at its core, a problem of reasoning. Across AI communities, researchers are developing diverse solutions for the problem of reasoning, from inference-time strategies and post-training of LLMs, to neuro-symbolic systems, Bayesian and probabilistic frameworks, geometric representations, and energy-based models. These efforts target the same problem: to move beyond pattern-matching systems toward structured, verifiable inference. However, they remain scattered across disciplines, making it difficult for IR researchers to identify the most relevant ideas and opportunities. To help navigate the fragmented landscape of research in reasoning, this tutorial first articulates a working definition of reasoning within the context of information retrieval and derives from it a unified analytical framework. The framework maps existing approaches along axes that reflect the core components of the definition. By providing a comprehensive overview of recent approaches and mapping current methods onto the defined axes, we expose their trade-offs and complementarities, highlight where IR can benefit from cross-disciplinary advances, and illustrate how retrieval process itself can play a central role in broader reasoning systems. The tutorial will equip participants with both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for enhancing reasoning-capable IR systems, while situating IR as a domain that both benefits and contributes to the broader development of reasoning methodologies.

- **TIPS Over Tricks: Simple Prompts for Effective Zero-shot Anomaly Detection**

  _2026-02-03_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03594v1 · `cs.CV`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Anomaly detection identifies departures from expected behavior in safety-critical settings. When target-domain normal data are unavailable, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) leverages vision-language models (VLMs). However, CLIP's coarse image-text alignment limits both localization and detection due to (i) spatial misalignment and (ii) weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies; prior work compensates with complex auxiliary modules yet largely overlooks the choice of backbone. We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture. Code is available at github.com/AlirezaSalehy/Tipsomaly.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Integrating hard constraints into deep learning is essential for safety-critical systems. Yet existing constructive layers that project predictions onto constraint boundaries face a fundamental bottleneck: gradient saturation. By collapsing exterior points onto lower-dimensional surfaces, standard orthogonal projections induce rank-deficient Jacobians, which nullify gradients orthogonal to active constraints and hinder optimization. We introduce Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable reparameterization layer that circumvents this issue through a radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set. This construction guarantees strict feasibility while preserving a full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere, thereby preventing the optimization stalls typical of boundary-based methods. We theoretically prove that the architecture retains the universal approximation property and empirically show improved convergence behavior and solution quality over state-of-the-art optimization- and projection-based baselines.

- **Causal Inference on Networks under Misspecified Exposure Mappings: A Partial Identification Framework**

  _2026-02-03_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03459v1 · `cs.LG`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Estimating treatment effects in networks is challenging, as each potential outcome depends on the treatments of all other nodes in the network. To overcome this difficulty, existing methods typically impose an exposure mapping that compresses the treatment assignments in the network into a low-dimensional summary. However, if this mapping is misspecified, standard estimators for direct and spillover effects can be severely biased. We propose a novel partial identification framework for causal inference on networks to assess the robustness of treatment effects under misspecifications of the exposure mapping. Specifically, we derive sharp upper and lower bounds on direct and spillover effects under such misspecifications. As such, our framework presents a novel application of causal sensitivity analysis to exposure mappings. We instantiate our framework for three canonical exposure settings widely used in practice: (i) weighted means of the neighborhood treatments, (ii) threshold-based exposure mappings, and (iii) truncated neighborhood interference in the presence of higher-order spillovers. Furthermore, we develop orthogonal estimators for these bounds and prove that the resulting bound estimates are valid, sharp, and efficient. Our experiments show the bounds remain informative and provide reliable conclusions under misspecification of exposure mappings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Manual endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is technically demanding, and existing single-segment robotic tools offer limited dexterity. These limitations motivate the development of more advanced solutions. To address this, DESectBot, a novel dual segment continuum robot with a decoupled structure and integrated surgical forceps, enabling 6 degrees of freedom (DoFs) tip dexterity for improved lesion targeting in ESD, was developed in this work. Deep learning controllers based on gated recurrent units (GRUs) for simultaneous tip position and orientation control, effectively handling the nonlinear coupling between continuum segments, were proposed. The GRU controller was benchmarked against Jacobian based inverse kinematics, model predictive control (MPC), a feedforward neural network (FNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In nested-rectangle and Lissajous trajectory tracking tasks, the GRU achieved the lowest position/orientation RMSEs: 1.11 mm/ 4.62° and 0.81 mm/ 2.59°, respectively. For orientation control at a fixed position (four target poses), the GRU attained a mean RMSE of 0.14 mm and 0.72°, outperforming all alternatives. In a peg transfer task, the GRU achieved a 100% success rate (120 success/120 attempts) with an average transfer time of 11.8s, the STD significantly outperforms novice-controlled systems. Additionally, an ex vivo ESD demonstration grasping, elevating, and resecting tissue as the scalpel completed the cut confirmed that DESectBot provides sufficient stiffness to divide thick gastric mucosa and an operative workspace adequate for large lesions.These results confirm that GRU-based control significantly enhances precision, reliability, and usability in ESD surgical training scenarios.

  We present EB-JEPA, an open-source library for learning representations and world models using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs). JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/eb_jepa.

  Quadruped robots face limitations in long-range navigation efficiency due to their reliance on legs. To ameliorate the limitations, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning-based Active Transporter Riding method (\textit{RL-ATR}), inspired by humans' utilization of personal transporters, including Segways. The \textit{RL-ATR} features a transporter riding policy and two state estimators. The policy devises adequate maneuvering strategies according to transporter-specific control dynamics, while the estimators resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation validate proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions within the \textit{RL-ATR}. This riding ability could broaden the locomotion modalities of quadruped robots, potentially expanding the operational range and efficiency.

  Continuum soft robots are inherently underactuated and subject to intrinsic input constraints, making dynamic control particularly challenging, especially in hybrid rigid-soft robots. While most existing methods focus on quasi-static behaviors, dynamic tasks such as swing-up require accurate exploitation of continuum dynamics. This has led to studies on simple low-order template systems that often fail to capture the complexity of real continuum deformations. Model-based optimal control offers a systematic solution; however, its application to rigid-soft robots is often limited by the computational cost and inaccuracy of numerical differentiation for high-dimensional models. Building on recent advances in the Geometric Variable Strain model that enable analytical derivatives, this work investigates three optimal control strategies for underactuated soft systems-Direct Collocation, Differential Dynamic Programming, and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-to perform dynamic swing-up tasks. To address stiff continuum dynamics and constrained actuation, implicit integration schemes and warm-start strategies are employed to improve numerical robustness and computational efficiency. The methods are evaluated in simulation on three Rigid-Soft and high-order soft benchmark systems-the Soft Cart-Pole, the Soft Pendubot, and the Soft Furuta Pendulum- highlighting their performance and computational trade-offs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Paleoradiology, the use of modern imaging technologies to study archaeological and anthropological remains, offers new windows on millennial scale patterns of human health. Unfortunately, the radiographs collected during field campaigns are heterogeneous: bones are disarticulated, positioning is ad hoc, and laterality markers are often absent. Additionally, factors such as age at death, age of bone, sex, and imaging equipment introduce high variability. Thus, content navigation, such as identifying a subset of images with a specific projection view, can be time consuming and difficult, making efficient triaging a bottleneck for expert analysis. We report a zero shot prompting strategy that leverages a state of the art Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) to automatically identify the main bone, projection view, and laterality in such images. Our pipeline converts raw DICOM files to bone windowed PNGs, submits them to the LVLM with a carefully engineered prompt, and receives structured JSON outputs, which are extracted and formatted onto a spreadsheet in preparation for validation. On a random sample of 100 images reviewed by an expert board certified paleoradiologist, the system achieved 92% main bone accuracy, 80% projection view accuracy, and 100% laterality accuracy, with low or medium confidence flags for ambiguous cases. These results suggest that LVLMs can substantially accelerate code word development for large paleoradiology datasets, allowing for efficient content navigation in future anthropology workflows.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We address dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects by presenting SPiD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework that couples an accurate deformable object model with an augmented self-supervised training strategy. On the modeling side, we extend a mass-spring model to more accurately capture object dynamics while remaining lightweight enough for high-throughput rollouts during self-supervised learning. On the learning side, we train a neural controller using a task-oriented cost, enabling end-to-end optimization through interaction with the differentiable object model. In addition, we propose a self-supervised DAgger variant that detects distribution shift during deployment and performs offline self-correction to further enhance robustness without expert supervision. We evaluate our method primarily on the rope stabilization task, where a robot must bring a swinging rope to rest as quickly and smoothly as possible. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves fast and smooth rope stabilization, generalizing across unseen initial states, rope lengths, masses, non-uniform mass distributions, and external disturbances. Additionally, we develop an affordable markerless rope perception method and demonstrate that our controller maintains performance with noisy and low-frequency state updates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the framework by extending it to the rope trajectory tracking task. Overall, SPiD offers a data-efficient, robust, and physically grounded framework for dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects, featuring strong sim-to-real generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Manual endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is technically demanding, and existing single-segment robotic tools offer limited dexterity. These limitations motivate the development of more advanced solutions. To address this, DESectBot, a novel dual segment continuum robot with a decoupled structure and integrated surgical forceps, enabling 6 degrees of freedom (DoFs) tip dexterity for improved lesion targeting in ESD, was developed in this work. Deep learning controllers based on gated recurrent units (GRUs) for simultaneous tip position and orientation control, effectively handling the nonlinear coupling between continuum segments, were proposed. The GRU controller was benchmarked against Jacobian based inverse kinematics, model predictive control (MPC), a feedforward neural network (FNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In nested-rectangle and Lissajous trajectory tracking tasks, the GRU achieved the lowest position/orientation RMSEs: 1.11 mm/ 4.62° and 0.81 mm/ 2.59°, respectively. For orientation control at a fixed position (four target poses), the GRU attained a mean RMSE of 0.14 mm and 0.72°, outperforming all alternatives. In a peg transfer task, the GRU achieved a 100% success rate (120 success/120 attempts) with an average transfer time of 11.8s, the STD significantly outperforms novice-controlled systems. Additionally, an ex vivo ESD demonstration grasping, elevating, and resecting tissue as the scalpel completed the cut confirmed that DESectBot provides sufficient stiffness to divide thick gastric mucosa and an operative workspace adequate for large lesions.These results confirm that GRU-based control significantly enhances precision, reliability, and usability in ESD surgical training scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Diffusion-based editing models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic image and video manipulation. However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets.

  Learning \emph{latent actions} from diverse human videos enables scaling robot learning beyond embodiment-specific robot datasets, and these latent actions have recently been used as pseudo-action labels for vision-language-action (VLA) model pretraining. To make VLA pretraining effective, latent actions should contain information about the underlying agent's actions despite the absence of ground-truth labels. We propose \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew\textbf{P}oint \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}ction \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MVP-LAM}), which learns discrete latent actions that are highly informative about ground-truth actions from time-synchronized multi-view videos. MVP-LAM trains latent actions with a \emph{cross-viewpoint reconstruction} objective, so that a latent action inferred from one view must explain the future in another view, reducing reliance on viewpoint-specific cues. On Bridge V2, MVP-LAM produces more action-centric latent actions, achieving higher mutual information with ground-truth actions and improved action prediction, including under out-of-distribution evaluation. Finally, pretraining VLAs with MVP-LAM latent actions improves downstream manipulation performance on the SIMPLER and LIBERO-Long benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Sampling-based controllers, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) methods, offer substantial flexibility but often suffer from high variance and low sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid variance-reduced MPPI framework that integrates a prior model into the sampling process. Our key insight is to decompose the objective function into a known approximate model and a residual term. Since the residual captures only the discrepancy between the model and the objective, it typically exhibits a smaller magnitude and lower variance than the original objective. Although this principle applies to general modeling choices, we demonstrate that adopting a quadratic approximation enables the derivation of a closed-form, model-guided prior that effectively concentrates samples in informative regions. Crucially, the framework is agnostic to the source of geometric information, allowing the quadratic model to be constructed from exact derivatives, structural approximations (e.g., Gauss- or Quasi-Newton), or gradient-free randomized smoothing. We validate the approach on standard optimization benchmarks, a nonlinear, underactuated cart-pole control task, and a contact-rich manipulation problem with non-smooth dynamics. Across these domains, we achieve faster convergence and superior performance in low-sample regimes compared to standard MPPI. These results suggest that the method can make sample-based control strategies more practical in scenarios where obtaining samples is expensive or limited.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  The advent of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represents a significant leap for embodied intelligence, yet their immense computational demands critically hinder deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware. Code will be released.

  Assisting non-expert users to develop complex interactive websites has become a popular task for LLM-powered code agents. However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation and general reasoning, yet their capacity for autonomous multi-stage planning in high-dimensional, physically constrained environments remains an open research question. This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an "LLM-as-a-Judge" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops. We conclude that, while current LLMs often demonstrate sufficient knowledge and intelligence to tackle space science tasks, they remain limited by an implementation barrier, functioning as powerful domain facilitators rather than fully autonomous engineers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Robust disturbance rejection remains a longstanding challenge in humanoid locomotion, particularly on unstructured terrains where sensing is unreliable and model mismatch is pronounced. While perception information, such as height map, enhances terrain awareness, sensor noise and sim-to-real gaps can destabilize policies in practice. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis that bounds the return gap under observation noise, when the induced latent dynamics are contractive. Furthermore, we present Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework that maps high-dimensional, disturbance-prone observations into a latent space, where local perturbations are attenuated over time. Specifically, this approach couples contrastive representation learning with Lipschitz regularization to preserve task-relevant geometry while explicitly controlling sensitivity. Notably, the formulation can be incorporated into modern deep reinforcement learning pipelines as an auxiliary loss term with minimal additional technical effort required. Further, our extensive humanoid experiments show that CMR potently outperforms other locomotion algorithms under increased noise.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We develop a continual learning method for pretrained models that \emph{requires no access to old-task data}, addressing a practical barrier in foundation model adaptation where pretraining distributions are often unavailable. Our key observation is that pretrained networks exhibit substantial \emph{geometric redundancy}, and that this redundancy can be exploited in two complementary ways. First, redundant neurons provide a proxy for dominant pretraining-era feature directions, enabling the construction of approximately protected update subspaces directly from pretrained weights. Second, redundancy offers a natural bias for \emph{where} to place plasticity: by restricting updates to a subset of redundant neurons and constraining the remaining degrees of freedom, we obtain update families with reduced functional drift on the old-data distribution and improved worst-case retention guarantees. These insights lead to \textsc{PLATE} (\textbf{Pla}sticity-\textbf{T}unable \textbf{E}fficient Adapters), a continual learning method requiring no past-task data that provides explicit control over the plasticity-retention trade-off. PLATE parameterizes each layer with a structured low-rank update $ΔW = B A Q^\top$, where $B$ and $Q$ are computed once from pretrained weights and kept frozen, and only $A$ is trained on the new task. The code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/PLATE.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Joint base station (BS) association and beam selection in multi-UAV aerial corridors constitutes a challenging radio resource management (RRM) problem. It is driven by high-dimensional action spaces, need for substantial overhead to acquire global channel state information (CSI), rapidly varying propagation channels, and stringent latency requirements. Conventional combinatorial optimization methods, while near-optimal, are computationally prohibitive for real-time operation in such dynamic environments. While learning-based approaches can mitigate computational complexity and CSI overhead, the need for extensive site-specific (SS) datasets for model training remains a key challenge. To address these challenges, we develop a Digital Twin (DT)-enabled two-stage optimization framework that couples physics-based beam gain modeling with DRL for scalable online decision-making. In the first stage, a channel twin (CT) is constructed using a high-fidelity ray-tracing solver with geo-spatial contexts, and network information to capture SS propagation characteristics, and dual annealing algorithm is employed to precompute optimal transmission beam directions. In the second stage, a Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (MH-PPO) agent, equipped with a scalable multi-head actor-critic architecture, is trained on the DT-generated channel dataset to directly map complex channel and beam states to jointly execute UAV-BS-beam association decisions. The proposed PPO agent achieves a 44%-121% improvement over DQN and 249%-807% gain over traditional heuristic based optimization schemes in a dense UAV scenario, while reducing inference latency by several orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that DT-driven training pipelines can deliver high-performance, low-latency RRM policies tailored to SS deployments suitable for real-time resource management in next-generation aerial corridor networks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made automated multiple-choice question (MCQ) generation increasingly feasible; however, reliably producing items that satisfy controlled cognitive demands remains a challenge. To address this gap, we introduce ReQUESTA, a hybrid, multi-agent framework for generating cognitively diverse MCQs that systematically target text-based, inferential, and main idea comprehension. ReQUESTA decomposes MCQ authoring into specialized subtasks and coordinates LLM-powered agents with rule-based components to support planning, controlled generation, iterative evaluation, and post-processing. We evaluated the framework in a large-scale reading comprehension study using academic expository texts, comparing ReQUESTA-generated MCQs with those produced by a single-pass GPT-5 zero-shot baseline. Psychometric analyses of learner responses assessed item difficulty and discrimination, while expert raters evaluated question quality across multiple dimensions, including topic relevance and distractor quality. Results showed that ReQUESTA-generated items were consistently more challenging, more discriminative, and more strongly aligned with overall reading comprehension performance. Expert evaluations further indicated stronger alignment with central concepts and superior distractor linguistic consistency and semantic plausibility, particularly for inferential questions. These findings demonstrate that hybrid, agentic orchestration can systematically improve the reliability and controllability of LLM-based generation, highlighting workflow design as a key lever for structured artifact generation beyond single-pass prompting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  While existing multi-agent systems (MAS) can handle complex problems by enabling collaboration among multiple agents, they are often highly task-specific, relying on manually crafted agent roles and interaction prompts, which leads to increased architectural complexity and limited reusability across tasks. Moreover, most MAS communicate primarily through natural language, making them vulnerable to error accumulation and instability in long-context, multi-stage interactions within internal agent histories. In this work, we propose \textbf{Agent Primitives}, a set of reusable latent building blocks for LLM-based MAS. Inspired by neural network design, where complex models are built from reusable components, we observe that many existing MAS architectures can be decomposed into a small number of recurring internal computation patterns. Based on this observation, we instantiate three primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution. All primitives communicate internally via key-value (KV) cache, which improves both robustness and efficiency by mitigating information degradation across multi-stage interactions. To enable automatic system construction, an Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations, forming a primitive-based MAS. Experiments show that primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5\% over single-agent baselines, reduce token usage and inference latency by approximately 3$\times$-4$\times$ compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3$\times$-1.6$\times$ overhead relative to single-agent inference and providing more stable performance across model backbones.

  Recent progress has expanded the use of large language models (LLMs) in drug discovery, including synthesis planning. However, objective evaluation of retrosynthesis performance remains limited. Existing benchmarks and metrics typically rely on published synthetic procedures and Top-K accuracy based on single ground-truth, which does not capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis planning. We propose a new benchmarking framework for single-step retrosynthesis that evaluates both general-purpose and chemistry-specialized LLMs using ChemCensor, a novel metric for chemical plausibility. By emphasizing plausibility over exact match, this approach better aligns with human synthesis planning practices. We also introduce CREED, a novel dataset comprising millions of ChemCensor-validated reaction records for LLM training, and use it to train a model that improves over the LLM baselines under this benchmark.

  Entropy serves as a critical metric for measuring the diversity of outputs generated by large language models (LLMs), providing valuable insights into their exploration capabilities. While recent studies increasingly focus on monitoring and adjusting entropy to better balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the entropy dynamics during the RFT process, which begins with a discriminant expression that quantifies entropy change under a single logit update. This foundation enables the derivation of a first-order expression for entropy change, which can be further extended to the update formula of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The corollaries and insights drawn from the theoretical analysis inspire the design of entropy control methods, and also offer a unified lens for interpreting various entropy-based methods in existing studies. We provide empirical evidence to support the main conclusions of our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived entropy-discriminator clipping methods. This study yields novel insights into RFT training dynamics, providing theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning.

  Multi-robot teams must coordinate to operate effectively. When a team operates in an uncoordinated manner, and agents choose actions that are only individually optimal, the team's outcome can suffer. However, in many domains, coordination requires costly communication. We explore the value of coordination in a broad class of differentiable motion-planning problems. In particular, we model coordinated behavior as a spectrum: at one extreme, agents jointly optimize a common team objective, and at the other, agents make unilaterally optimal decisions given their individual decision variables, i.e., they operate at Nash equilibria. We then demonstrate that reasoning about coordination in differentiable motion-planning problems reduces to reasoning about the second-order properties of agents' objectives, and we provide algorithms that use this second-order reasoning to determine at which times a team of agents should coordinate.

  Since the recent Covid-19 pandemic, mobile manipulators and humanoid assistive robots with higher levels of autonomy have increasingly been adopted for patient care and living assistance. Despite advancements in autonomy, these robots often struggle to perform reliably in dynamic and unstructured environments and require human intervention to recover from failures. Effective human-robot collaboration is essential to enable robots to receive assistance from the most competent operator, in order to reduce their workload and minimize disruptions in task execution. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for allocating robotic failures to human operators (ARFA). Our proposed approach models the capabilities of human operators, and continuously updates these beliefs based on their actual performance for failure recovery. For every failure to be resolved, a reward function calculates expected outcomes based on operator capabilities and historical data, task urgency, and current workload distribution. The failure is then assigned to the operator with the highest expected reward. Our simulations and user studies show that ARFA outperforms random allocation, significantly reducing robot idle time, improving overall system performance, and leading to a more distributed workload among operators.

  Machine learning-based anomaly detection systems are increasingly being adopted in 5G Core networks to monitor complex, high-volume traffic. However, most existing approaches are evaluated under strong assumptions that rarely hold in operational environments, notably the availability of independent and identically distributed (IID) data and the absence of adaptive attackers.In this work, we study the problem of detecting 5G attacks \textit{in the wild}, focusing on realistic deployment settings. We propose a set of Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating anomaly detectors in 5G Core Network (SAGE-5GC), driven by domain knowledge and consideration of potential adversarial threats. Using a realistic 5G Core dataset, we first train several anomaly detectors and assess their baseline performance against standard 5GC control-plane cyberattacks targeting PFCP-based network services.We then extend the evaluation to adversarial settings, where an attacker tries to manipulate the observable features of the network traffic to evade detection, under the constraint that the intended functionality of the malicious traffic is preserved. Starting from a selected set of controllable features, we analyze model sensitivity and adversarial robustness through randomized perturbations. Finally, we introduce a practical optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms that operates exclusively on attacker-controllable features and does not require prior knowledge of the underlying detection model. Our experimental results show that adversarially crafted attacks can substantially degrade detection performance, underscoring the need for robust, security-aware evaluation methodologies for anomaly detection in 5G networks deployed in the wild.

## Safety, Robustness, Uncertainty

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Designing provably safe control is a core problem in trustworthy autonomy. However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward.

  Guaranteeing safety in the presence of unmatched disturbances -- uncertainties that cannot be directly canceled by the control input -- remains a key challenge in nonlinear control. This paper presents a constructive approach to safety-critical control of nonlinear systems with unmatched disturbances. We first present a generalization of the input-to-state safety (ISSf) framework for systems with these uncertainties using the recently developed notion of an Optimal Decay CBF, which provides more flexibility for satisfying the associated Lyapunov-like conditions for safety. From there, we outline a procedure for constructing ISSf-CBFs for two relevant classes of systems with unmatched uncertainties: i) strict-feedback systems; ii) dual-relative-degree systems, which are similar to differentially flat systems. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations of an inverted pendulum and planar quadrotor.

  Anomaly detection identifies departures from expected behavior in safety-critical settings. When target-domain normal data are unavailable, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) leverages vision-language models (VLMs). However, CLIP's coarse image-text alignment limits both localization and detection due to (i) spatial misalignment and (ii) weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies; prior work compensates with complex auxiliary modules yet largely overlooks the choice of backbone. We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We address dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects by presenting SPiD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework that couples an accurate deformable object model with an augmented self-supervised training strategy. On the modeling side, we extend a mass-spring model to more accurately capture object dynamics while remaining lightweight enough for high-throughput rollouts during self-supervised learning. On the learning side, we train a neural controller using a task-oriented cost, enabling end-to-end optimization through interaction with the differentiable object model. In addition, we propose a self-supervised DAgger variant that detects distribution shift during deployment and performs offline self-correction to further enhance robustness without expert supervision. We evaluate our method primarily on the rope stabilization task, where a robot must bring a swinging rope to rest as quickly and smoothly as possible. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves fast and smooth rope stabilization, generalizing across unseen initial states, rope lengths, masses, non-uniform mass distributions, and external disturbances. Additionally, we develop an affordable markerless rope perception method and demonstrate that our controller maintains performance with noisy and low-frequency state updates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the framework by extending it to the rope trajectory tracking task. Overall, SPiD offers a data-efficient, robust, and physically grounded framework for dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects, featuring strong sim-to-real generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Robotics and Autonomous Systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, so that demonstrating their safety is essential. Assurance Cases (ACs) provide structured arguments supported by evidence, but generating and maintaining this evidence is labour-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to keep consistent as systems evolve. We present a model-based approach to systematically generating AC evidence by embedding formal verification into the assurance workflow. The approach addresses three challenges: systematically deriving formal assertions from natural language requirements using templates, orchestrating multiple formal verification tools to handle diverse property types, and integrating formal evidence production into the workflow. Leveraging RoboChart, a domain-specific modelling language with formal semantics, we combine model checking and theorem proving in our approach. Structured requirements are automatically transformed into formal assertions using predefined templates, and verification results are automatically integrated as evidence. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  Robust disturbance rejection remains a longstanding challenge in humanoid locomotion, particularly on unstructured terrains where sensing is unreliable and model mismatch is pronounced. While perception information, such as height map, enhances terrain awareness, sensor noise and sim-to-real gaps can destabilize policies in practice. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis that bounds the return gap under observation noise, when the induced latent dynamics are contractive. Furthermore, we present Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework that maps high-dimensional, disturbance-prone observations into a latent space, where local perturbations are attenuated over time. Specifically, this approach couples contrastive representation learning with Lipschitz regularization to preserve task-relevant geometry while explicitly controlling sensitivity. Notably, the formulation can be incorporated into modern deep reinforcement learning pipelines as an auxiliary loss term with minimal additional technical effort required. Further, our extensive humanoid experiments show that CMR potently outperforms other locomotion algorithms under increased noise.

  Autonomous inspection of underground infrastructure, such as sewer and culvert systems, is critical to public safety and urban sustainability. Although robotic platforms equipped with visual sensors can efficiently detect structural deficiencies, the automated generation of human-readable summaries from these detections remains a significant challenge, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline for end-to-end summarization of underground deficiencies, combining our lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployed on an edge computing platform. The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. We deploy and evaluate our complete pipeline on a mobile robotic platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world inspection scenarios. Our results show the potential of edge-deployable integrated AI systems to bridge the gap between automated defect detection and actionable insights for infrastructure maintenance, paving the way for more scalable and autonomous inspection solutions.

  While existing multi-agent systems (MAS) can handle complex problems by enabling collaboration among multiple agents, they are often highly task-specific, relying on manually crafted agent roles and interaction prompts, which leads to increased architectural complexity and limited reusability across tasks. Moreover, most MAS communicate primarily through natural language, making them vulnerable to error accumulation and instability in long-context, multi-stage interactions within internal agent histories. In this work, we propose \textbf{Agent Primitives}, a set of reusable latent building blocks for LLM-based MAS. Inspired by neural network design, where complex models are built from reusable components, we observe that many existing MAS architectures can be decomposed into a small number of recurring internal computation patterns. Based on this observation, we instantiate three primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution. All primitives communicate internally via key-value (KV) cache, which improves both robustness and efficiency by mitigating information degradation across multi-stage interactions. To enable automatic system construction, an Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations, forming a primitive-based MAS. Experiments show that primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5\% over single-agent baselines, reduce token usage and inference latency by approximately 3$\times$-4$\times$ compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3$\times$-1.6$\times$ overhead relative to single-agent inference and providing more stable performance across model backbones.

  Lane detection is a crucial perception task for all levels of automated vehicles (AVs) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, particularly in mixed-traffic environments where AVs must interact with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and challenging traffic scenarios. Current methods lack versatility in delivering accurate, robust, and real-time compatible lane detection, especially vision-based methods often neglect critical regions of the image and their spatial-temporal (ST) salience, leading to poor performance in difficult circumstances such as serious occlusion and dazzle lighting. This study introduces a novel sequential neural network model with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on key features of lane lines and exploit salient ST correlations among continuous image frames. The proposed model, built on a standard encoder-decoder structure and common neural network backbones, is trained and evaluated on three large-scale open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength and robustness of the proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various testing scenarios. Furthermore, with the ST attention mechanism, the developed sequential neural network models exhibit fewer parameters and reduced Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to baseline sequential models, highlighting their computational efficiency. Relevant data, code, and models are released at https://doi.org/10.4121/4619cab6-ae4a-40d5-af77-582a77f3d821.

  Learning \emph{latent actions} from diverse human videos enables scaling robot learning beyond embodiment-specific robot datasets, and these latent actions have recently been used as pseudo-action labels for vision-language-action (VLA) model pretraining. To make VLA pretraining effective, latent actions should contain information about the underlying agent's actions despite the absence of ground-truth labels. We propose \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew\textbf{P}oint \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}ction \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MVP-LAM}), which learns discrete latent actions that are highly informative about ground-truth actions from time-synchronized multi-view videos. MVP-LAM trains latent actions with a \emph{cross-viewpoint reconstruction} objective, so that a latent action inferred from one view must explain the future in another view, reducing reliance on viewpoint-specific cues. On Bridge V2, MVP-LAM produces more action-centric latent actions, achieving higher mutual information with ground-truth actions and improved action prediction, including under out-of-distribution evaluation. Finally, pretraining VLAs with MVP-LAM latent actions improves downstream manipulation performance on the SIMPLER and LIBERO-Long benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Object detection is pivotal in computer vision, yet its immense computational demands make deployment slow and power-hungry, motivating quantization. However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples. Experiments on the COCO and nuScenes benchmarks show consistent reductions in quantization error for camera-based (2D and 3D) and LiDAR-based (3D) object detection.

  Integrating hard constraints into deep learning is essential for safety-critical systems. Yet existing constructive layers that project predictions onto constraint boundaries face a fundamental bottleneck: gradient saturation. By collapsing exterior points onto lower-dimensional surfaces, standard orthogonal projections induce rank-deficient Jacobians, which nullify gradients orthogonal to active constraints and hinder optimization. We introduce Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable reparameterization layer that circumvents this issue through a radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set. This construction guarantees strict feasibility while preserving a full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere, thereby preventing the optimization stalls typical of boundary-based methods. We theoretically prove that the architecture retains the universal approximation property and empirically show improved convergence behavior and solution quality over state-of-the-art optimization- and projection-based baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Estimating treatment effects in networks is challenging, as each potential outcome depends on the treatments of all other nodes in the network. To overcome this difficulty, existing methods typically impose an exposure mapping that compresses the treatment assignments in the network into a low-dimensional summary. However, if this mapping is misspecified, standard estimators for direct and spillover effects can be severely biased. We propose a novel partial identification framework for causal inference on networks to assess the robustness of treatment effects under misspecifications of the exposure mapping. Specifically, we derive sharp upper and lower bounds on direct and spillover effects under such misspecifications. As such, our framework presents a novel application of causal sensitivity analysis to exposure mappings. We instantiate our framework for three canonical exposure settings widely used in practice: (i) weighted means of the neighborhood treatments, (ii) threshold-based exposure mappings, and (iii) truncated neighborhood interference in the presence of higher-order spillovers. Furthermore, we develop orthogonal estimators for these bounds and prove that the resulting bound estimates are valid, sharp, and efficient. Our experiments show the bounds remain informative and provide reliable conclusions under misspecification of exposure mappings.

  Continuum soft robots are inherently underactuated and subject to intrinsic input constraints, making dynamic control particularly challenging, especially in hybrid rigid-soft robots. While most existing methods focus on quasi-static behaviors, dynamic tasks such as swing-up require accurate exploitation of continuum dynamics. This has led to studies on simple low-order template systems that often fail to capture the complexity of real continuum deformations. Model-based optimal control offers a systematic solution; however, its application to rigid-soft robots is often limited by the computational cost and inaccuracy of numerical differentiation for high-dimensional models. Building on recent advances in the Geometric Variable Strain model that enable analytical derivatives, this work investigates three optimal control strategies for underactuated soft systems-Direct Collocation, Differential Dynamic Programming, and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-to perform dynamic swing-up tasks. To address stiff continuum dynamics and constrained actuation, implicit integration schemes and warm-start strategies are employed to improve numerical robustness and computational efficiency. The methods are evaluated in simulation on three Rigid-Soft and high-order soft benchmark systems-the Soft Cart-Pole, the Soft Pendubot, and the Soft Furuta Pendulum- highlighting their performance and computational trade-offs.
