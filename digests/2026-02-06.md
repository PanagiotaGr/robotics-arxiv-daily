  Controllable video generation has emerged as a versatile tool for autonomous driving, enabling realistic synthesis of traffic scenarios. However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.

  In this work, we introduce \textbf{XSIM}, a sensor simulation framework for autonomous driving. XSIM extends 3DGUT splatting with a generalized rolling-shutter modeling tailored for autonomous driving applications. Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet. Our framework consistently outperforms strong recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

- **Thinking with Geometry: Active Geometry Integration for Spatial Reasoning**  
  Haoyuan Li, Qihang Cao, Tao Tang, Kun Xiang, Zihan Guo, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang  
  _2026-02-05_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06037v1 · `cs.CV`  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence. Code can be found at https://github.com/Li-Hao-yuan/GeoThinker.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Detecting small and distant objects remains challenging for object detectors due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects for safe planning. Depth information can improve detection, but existing approaches require complex, model-specific architectural modifications. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by an empirical investigation of the depth-detection relationship. Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections). DepthPrior offers these benefits without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs. Code is available at https://github.com/mos-ks/DepthPrior.

  Automated Driving System (ADS) acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles, responsible for their safety and efficiency. Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.

  Reliable terrain perception is a critical prerequisite for the deployment of humanoid robots in unstructured, human-centric environments. While traditional systems often rely on manually engineered, single-sensor pipelines, this paper presents a learning-based framework that uses an intermediate, robot-centric heightmap representation. A hybrid Encoder-Decoder Structure (EDS) is introduced, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction fused with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) core for temporal consistency. The architecture integrates multimodal data from an Intel RealSense depth camera, a LIVOX MID-360 LiDAR processed via efficient spherical projection, and an onboard IMU. Quantitative results demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves reconstruction accuracy by 7.2% over depth-only and 9.9% over LiDAR-only configurations. Furthermore, the integration of a 3.2 s temporal context reduces mapping drift.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Robotic navigation has historically struggled to reconcile reactive, sensor-based control with the decisive capabilities of model-based planners. This duality becomes critical when the absence of a predominant option among goals leads to indecision, challenging reactive systems to break symmetries without computationally-intense planners. We propose a parsimonious neuromorphic control framework that bridges this gap for vision-guided navigation and tracking. Image pixels from an onboard camera are encoded as inputs to dynamic neuronal populations that directly transform visual target excitation into egocentric motion commands. A dynamic bifurcation mechanism resolves indecision by delaying commitment until a critical point induced by the environmental geometry. Inspired by recently proposed mechanistic models of animal cognition and opinion dynamics, the neuromorphic controller provides real-time autonomy with a minimal computational burden, a small number of interpretable parameters, and can be seamlessly integrated with application-specific image processing pipelines. We validate our approach in simulation environments as well as on an experimental quadrotor platform.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  This paper proposes an Improved Noisy Deep Q-Network (Noisy DQN) to enhance the exploration and stability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) when applying deep reinforcement learning in simulated environments. This method enhances the exploration ability by combining the residual NoisyLinear layer with an adaptive noise scheduling mechanism, while improving training stability through smooth loss and soft target network updates. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves faster convergence and up to $+40$ higher rewards compared to standard DQN and quickly reach to the minimum number of steps required for the task 28 in the 15 * 15 grid navigation environment set up. The results show that our comprehensive improvements to the network structure of NoisyNet, exploration control, and training stability contribute to enhancing the efficiency and reliability of deep Q-learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Indoor micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) are increasingly used for tasks that require close proximity to people, yet practitioners lack practical methods to tune motion limits based on measured impact risk. We present an end-to-end, open toolchain that converts benchtop impact tests into deployable safety governors for drones. First, we describe a compact and replicable impact rig and protocol for capturing force-time profiles across drone classes and contact surfaces. Second, we provide data-driven models that map pre-impact speed to impulse and contact duration, enabling direct computation of speed bounds for a target force limit. Third, we release scripts and a ROS2 node that enforce these bounds online and log compliance, with support for facility-specific policies. We validate the workflow on multiple commercial off-the-shelf quadrotors and representative indoor assets, demonstrating that the derived governors preserve task throughput while meeting force constraints specified by safety stakeholders. Our contribution is a practical bridge from measured impacts to runtime limits, with shareable datasets, code, and a repeatable process that teams can adopt to certify indoor MAV operations near humans.

- **ShapeUP: Scalable Image-Conditioned 3D Editing**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Recent advancements in 3D foundation models have enabled the generation of high-fidelity assets, yet precise 3D manipulation remains a significant challenge. Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This image-as-prompt approach enables fine-grained visual control over both local and global edits and achieves implicit, mask-free localization, while maintaining strict structural consistency with the original asset. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ShapeUP consistently outperforms current trained and training-free baselines in both identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.

- **VisRefiner: Learning from Visual Differences for Screenshot-to-Code Generation**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Screenshot-to-code generation aims to translate user interface screenshots into executable frontend code that faithfully reproduces the target layout and style. Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.

  Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved widely applications in various computer vision tasks, e.g., text-to-image generation, Image-Text retrieval and Image captioning. However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.

- **Regularized Calibration with Successive Rounding for Post-Training Quantization**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has led to increasingly complex and heterogeneous network topologies. Traditional network monitoring and visualization tools rely on aggregated metrics or static representations, which fail to capture the evolving relationships and structural dependencies between devices. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to learn from relational data, their internal representations often remain opaque and difficult to interpret for security-critical operations. Consequently, this work introduces an interpretable pipeline that generates directly visualizable low-dimensional representations by mapping high-dimensional embeddings onto a latent manifold. This projection enables the interpretable monitoring and interoperability of evolving network states, while integrated feature attribution techniques decode the specific characteristics shaping the manifold structure. The framework achieves a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection while also highlighting phenomena such as concept drift. Ultimately, the presented approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional GNN embeddings and human-understandable network behavior, offering new insights for network administrators and security analysts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  This work examines a disc-centric approach for automated severity grading of lumbar spinal stenosis from sagittal T2-weighted MRI. The method combines contrastive pretraining with disc-level fine-tuning, using a single anatomically localized region of interest per intervertebral disc. Contrastive learning is employed to help the model focus on meaningful disc features and reduce sensitivity to irrelevant differences in image appearance. The framework includes an auxiliary regression task for disc localization and applies weighted focal loss to address class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate a 78.1% balanced accuracy and a reduced severe-to-normal misclassification rate of 2.13% compared with supervised training from scratch. Detecting discs with moderate severity can still be challenging, but focusing on disc-level features provides a practical way to assess the lumbar spinal stenosis.

  In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.

- **Exploring the Temporal Consistency for Point-Level Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PTAL) adopts a lightly frame-annotated paradigm (\textit{i.e.}, labeling only a single frame per action instance) to train a model to effectively locate action instances within untrimmed videos. Most existing approaches design the task head of models with only a point-supervised snippet-level classification, without explicit modeling of understanding temporal relationships among frames of an action. However, understanding the temporal relationships of frames is crucial because it can help a model understand how an action is defined and therefore benefits localizing the full frames of an action. To this end, in this paper, we design a multi-task learning framework that fully utilizes point supervision to boost the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization. Specifically, we design three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: (i) Action Completion, (ii) Action Order Understanding, and (iii) Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks help a model understand the temporal consistency of actions across videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly explore temporal consistency for point supervision action localization. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

  Mode-dependent architectural components (layers that behave differently during training and evaluation, such as Batch Normalization or dropout) are commonly used in visual reinforcement learning but can destabilize on-policy optimization. We show that in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), discrepancies between training and evaluation behavior induced by Batch Normalization lead to policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse. We propose Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without architectural changes. Experiments across procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks demonstrate that MDR consistently improves stability and performance, and extends naturally to other mode-dependent layers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Opportunities for medical students to gain practical experience in vaginal births are increasingly constrained by shortened clinical rotations, patient reluctance, and the unpredictable nature of labour. To alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency, we introduce a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training that combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, thereby preserving authentic haptic feedback while enabling independent practice without continuous on-site expert supervision. The system extends the passthrough capability of commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs) by spatially calibrating an external RGB-D camera, allowing real-time visual integration of physical training objects. Building on this capability, we implement a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline that first aligns the maternal manikin with fiducial markers to define a delivery region and then registers the pre-scanned neonatal head within this area. This process enables spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands near the manikin, allowing trainees to follow expert trajectories reinforced by haptic interaction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves accurate and stable manikin localization on a standalone headset, ensuring practical deployment without external computing resources. A large-scale user study involving 83 fourth-year medical students was subsequently conducted to compare MR-based and virtual reality (VR)-based childbirth training. Four senior obstetricians independently assessed performance using standardized criteria. Results showed that MR training achieved significantly higher scores in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance, and was consistently preferred by trainees over VR training.

- **Geometric Observability Index: An Operator-Theoretic Framework for Per-Feature Sensitivity, Weak Observability, and Dynamic Effects in SE(3) Pose Estimation**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on the Lie group SE(3). Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3). The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace. GOI admits a spectral decomposition along the principal directions of the observable curvature, revealing a direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In the population regime, GOI coincides with the Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding a single-measurement analogue of the Cramer-Rao bound. The same spectral mechanism explains classical degeneracies such as pure rotation and vanishing parallax, as well as dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions. Overall, GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator. Because these quantities arise directly within Gauss-Newton pipelines, the curvature spectrum and GOI also yield lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Navigating through dense human crowds remains a significant challenge for mobile robots. A key issue is the freezing robot problem, where the robot struggles to find safe motions and becomes stuck within the crowd. To address this, we propose HiCrowd, a hierarchical framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with model predictive control (MPC). HiCrowd leverages surrounding pedestrian motion as guidance, enabling the robot to align with compatible crowd flows. A high-level RL policy generates a follow point to align the robot with a suitable pedestrian group, while a low-level MPC safely tracks this guidance with short horizon planning. The method combines long-term crowd aware decision making with safe short-term execution. We evaluate HiCrowd against reactive and learning-based baselines in offline setting (replaying recorded human trajectories) and online setting (human trajectories are updated to react to the robot in simulation). Experiments on a real-world dataset and a synthetic crowd dataset show that our method outperforms in navigation efficiency and safety, while reducing freezing behaviors. Our results suggest that leveraging human motion as guidance, rather than treating humans solely as dynamic obstacles, provides a powerful principle for safe and efficient robot navigation in crowds.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Robotic navigation has historically struggled to reconcile reactive, sensor-based control with the decisive capabilities of model-based planners. This duality becomes critical when the absence of a predominant option among goals leads to indecision, challenging reactive systems to break symmetries without computationally-intense planners. We propose a parsimonious neuromorphic control framework that bridges this gap for vision-guided navigation and tracking. Image pixels from an onboard camera are encoded as inputs to dynamic neuronal populations that directly transform visual target excitation into egocentric motion commands. A dynamic bifurcation mechanism resolves indecision by delaying commitment until a critical point induced by the environmental geometry. Inspired by recently proposed mechanistic models of animal cognition and opinion dynamics, the neuromorphic controller provides real-time autonomy with a minimal computational burden, a small number of interpretable parameters, and can be seamlessly integrated with application-specific image processing pipelines. We validate our approach in simulation environments as well as on an experimental quadrotor platform.

  This paper proposes an Improved Noisy Deep Q-Network (Noisy DQN) to enhance the exploration and stability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) when applying deep reinforcement learning in simulated environments. This method enhances the exploration ability by combining the residual NoisyLinear layer with an adaptive noise scheduling mechanism, while improving training stability through smooth loss and soft target network updates. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves faster convergence and up to $+40$ higher rewards compared to standard DQN and quickly reach to the minimum number of steps required for the task 28 in the 15 * 15 grid navigation environment set up. The results show that our comprehensive improvements to the network structure of NoisyNet, exploration control, and training stability contribute to enhancing the efficiency and reliability of deep Q-learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  With the rising need for spatially grounded tasks such as Vision-Language Navigation/Action, allocentric perception capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are receiving growing focus. However, VLMs remain brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, where the answer depends on reasoning in a target-centric frame rather than the observed camera view. Thus, we introduce Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that recovers metric 3D states from one or more images with off-the-shelf geometric experts, and then instantiates a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame aligned with the instruction's semantic intent. By deterministically transforming reconstructed geometry into the target frame and prompting the backbone VLM with structured, geometry-grounded representations, Allocentric Perceriver offloads mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation. We evaluate Allocentric Perciver across multiple backbone families on spatial reasoning benchmarks, observing consistent and substantial gains ($\sim$10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, and surpassing both spatial-perception-finetuned models and state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Detecting small and distant objects remains challenging for object detectors due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects for safe planning. Depth information can improve detection, but existing approaches require complex, model-specific architectural modifications. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by an empirical investigation of the depth-detection relationship. Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections). DepthPrior offers these benefits without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs. Code is available at https://github.com/mos-ks/DepthPrior.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We introduce multi-task Visuo-Tactile World Models (VT-WM), which capture the physics of contact through touch reasoning. By complementing vision with tactile sensing, VT-WM better understands robot-object interactions in contact-rich tasks, avoiding common failure modes of vision-only models under occlusion or ambiguous contact states, such as objects disappearing, teleporting, or moving in ways that violate basic physics. Trained across a set of contact-rich manipulation tasks, VT-WM improves physical fidelity in imagination, achieving 33% better performance at maintaining object permanence and 29% better compliance with the laws of motion in autoregressive rollouts. Moreover, experiments show that grounding in contact dynamics also translates to planning. In zero-shot real-robot experiments, VT-WM achieves up to 35% higher success rates, with the largest gains in multi-step, contact-rich tasks. Finally, VT-WM demonstrates significant downstream versatility, effectively adapting its learned contact dynamics to a novel task and achieving reliable planning success with only a limited set of demonstrations.

  Recent advancements in 3D foundation models have enabled the generation of high-fidelity assets, yet precise 3D manipulation remains a significant challenge. Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This image-as-prompt approach enables fine-grained visual control over both local and global edits and achieves implicit, mask-free localization, while maintaining strict structural consistency with the original asset. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ShapeUP consistently outperforms current trained and training-free baselines in both identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.

  Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \textsc{Low}/\textsc{Mid}/\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.

  Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

  Recent advances in diffusion-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of continuous control tasks. However, existing works in this field focus on the application of diffusion policies while leaving the diffusion critics unexplored. In fact, since policy optimization fundamentally relies on the critic, accurate value estimation is far more important than policy expressiveness. Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value. This allows us to accurately capture the value distribution and prevents it from collapsing into a trivial Gaussian distribution owing to the strong distribution-matching capability of the diffusion bridge. Moreover, we further derive an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in DBC, which is essential in value estimation. To our knowledge, DBC is the first work to employ the diffusion bridge model as the critic. Notably, DBC is also a plug-and-play component and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks. Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DBC compared with previous distributional critic models.

  With the growing employment of learning algorithms in robotic applications, research on reinforcement learning for bipedal locomotion has become a central topic for humanoid robotics. While recently published contributions achieve high success rates in locomotion tasks, scarce attention has been devoted to the development of methods that enable to handle hardware faults that may occur during the locomotion process. However, in real-world settings, environmental disturbances or sudden occurrences of hardware faults might yield severe consequences. To address these issues, this paper presents TOLEBI (A faulT-tOlerant Learning framEwork for Bipedal locomotIon) that handles faults on the robot during operation. Specifically, joint locking, power loss and external disturbances are injected in simulation to learn fault-tolerant locomotion strategies. In addition to transferring the learned policy to the real robot via sim-to-real transfer, an online joint status module incorporated. This module enables to classify joint conditions by referring to the actual observations at runtime under real-world conditions. The validation experiments conducted both in real-world and simulation with the humanoid robot TOCABI highlight the applicability of the proposed approach. To our knowledge, this manuscript provides the first learning-based fault-tolerant framework for bipedal locomotion, thereby fostering the development of efficient learning methods in this field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.

  How does the amount of compute available to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy affect its learning? Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Screenshot-to-code generation aims to translate user interface screenshots into executable frontend code that faithfully reproduces the target layout and style. Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.

  Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  This paper studies the container lifting phase of a waste-container recycling task in urban environments, performed by a hydraulic loader crane equipped with an underactuated discharge unit, and proposes a residual reinforcement learning (RRL) approach that combines a nominal Cartesian controller with a learned residual policy. All experiments are conducted in simulation, where the task is characterized by tight geometric tolerances between the discharge-unit hooks and the container rings relative to the overall crane scale, making precise trajectory tracking and swing suppression essential. The nominal controller uses admittance control for trajectory tracking and pendulum-aware swing damping, followed by damped least-squares inverse kinematics with a nullspace posture term to generate joint velocity commands. A PPO-trained residual policy in Isaac Lab compensates for unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations, improving precision and robustness without requiring end-to-end learning from scratch. We further employ randomized episode initialization and domain randomization over payload properties, actuator gains, and passive joint parameters to enhance generalization. Simulation results demonstrate improved tracking accuracy, reduced oscillations, and higher lifting success rates compared to the nominal controller alone.

  The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.

  Task-oriented handovers (TOH) are fundamental to effective human-robot collaboration, requiring robots to present objects in a way that supports the human's intended post-handover use. Existing approaches are typically based on object- or task-specific affordances, but their ability to generalize to novel scenarios is limited. To address this gap, we present AFT-Handover, a framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven affordance reasoning with efficient texture-based affordance transfer to achieve zero-shot, generalizable TOH. Given a novel object-task pair, the method retrieves a proxy exemplar from a database, establishes part-level correspondences via LLM reasoning, and texturizes affordances for feature-based point cloud transfer. We evaluate AFT-Handover across diverse task-object pairs, showing improved handover success rates and stronger generalization compared to baselines. In a comparative user study, our framework is significantly preferred over the current state-of-the-art, effectively reducing human regrasping before tool use. Finally, we demonstrate TOH on legged manipulators, highlighting the potential of our framework for real-world robot-human handovers.

  In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.

  Automated Driving System (ADS) acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles, responsible for their safety and efficiency. Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.

  The well-studied DISPERSION problem is a fundamental coordination problem in distributed robotics, where a set of mobile robots must relocate so that each occupies a distinct node of a network. DISPERSION assumes that a robot can settle at any node as long as no other robot settles on that node. In this work, we introduce LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION that incorporates location awareness: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an anonymous, connected, undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes, each labeled with a color $\sf{col}(v) \in C = \{c_1, \dots, c_t\}, t\leq n$. A set $R = \{r_1, \dots, r_k\}$ of $k \leq n$ mobile robots is given, where each robot $r_i$ has an associated color $\mathsf{col}(r_i) \in C$. Initially placed arbitrarily on the graph, the goal is to relocate the robots so that each occupies a distinct node of the same color. When $|C|=1$, LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION reduces to DISPERSION. There is a solution to DISPERSION in graphs with any $k\leq n$ without knowing $k,n$. Like DISPERSION, the goal is to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION minimizing both time and memory requirement at each agent. We develop several deterministic algorithms with guaranteed bounds on both time and memory requirement. We also give an impossibility and a lower bound for any deterministic algorithm for LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION. To the best of our knowledge, the presented results collectively establish the algorithmic feasibility of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION in anonymous networks and also highlight the challenges on getting an efficient solution compared to the solutions for DISPERSION.

  Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.

  Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

  Navigating through dense human crowds remains a significant challenge for mobile robots. A key issue is the freezing robot problem, where the robot struggles to find safe motions and becomes stuck within the crowd. To address this, we propose HiCrowd, a hierarchical framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with model predictive control (MPC). HiCrowd leverages surrounding pedestrian motion as guidance, enabling the robot to align with compatible crowd flows. A high-level RL policy generates a follow point to align the robot with a suitable pedestrian group, while a low-level MPC safely tracks this guidance with short horizon planning. The method combines long-term crowd aware decision making with safe short-term execution. We evaluate HiCrowd against reactive and learning-based baselines in offline setting (replaying recorded human trajectories) and online setting (human trajectories are updated to react to the robot in simulation). Experiments on a real-world dataset and a synthetic crowd dataset show that our method outperforms in navigation efficiency and safety, while reducing freezing behaviors. Our results suggest that leveraging human motion as guidance, rather than treating humans solely as dynamic obstacles, provides a powerful principle for safe and efficient robot navigation in crowds.

  Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a principled planning model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.

  Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.

  Detecting small and distant objects remains challenging for object detectors due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects for safe planning. Depth information can improve detection, but existing approaches require complex, model-specific architectural modifications. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by an empirical investigation of the depth-detection relationship. Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections). DepthPrior offers these benefits without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs. Code is available at https://github.com/mos-ks/DepthPrior.

The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.

  LiDAR point clouds captured in rain or snow are often corrupted by weather-induced returns, which can degrade perception and safety-critical scene understanding. This paper proposes Intensity- and Distance-Aware Statistical Outlier Removal (IDSOR), a range-adaptive filtering method that jointly exploits intensity cues and neighborhood sparsity. By incorporating an empirical, range-dependent distribution of weather returns into the threshold design, IDSOR suppresses weather-induced points while preserving fine structural details without cumbersome manual parameter tuning. We also propose a variant that uses a previously proposed method to estimate the weather return distribution from data, and integrates it into IDSOR. Experiments on simulation-augmented level-crossing measurements and on the Winter Adverse Driving dataset (WADS) demonstrate that IDSOR achieves a favorable precision-recall trade-off, maintaining both precision and recall above 90% on WADS.

  Learning-based whole-body controllers have become a key driver for humanoid robots, yet most existing approaches require robot-specific training. In this paper, we study the problem of cross-embodiment humanoid control and show that a single policy can robustly generalize across a wide range of humanoid robot designs with one-time training. We introduce XHugWBC, a novel cross-embodiment training framework that enables generalist humanoid control through: (1) physics-consistent morphological randomization, (2) semantically aligned observation and action spaces across diverse humanoid robots, and (3) effective policy architectures modeling morphological and dynamical properties. XHugWBC is not tied to any specific robot. Instead, it internalizes a broad distribution of morphological and dynamical characteristics during training. By learning motion priors from diverse randomized embodiments, the policy acquires a strong structural bias that supports zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robots. Experiments on twelve simulated humanoids and seven real-world robots demonstrate the strong generalization and robustness of the resulting universal controller.

  Indoor micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) are increasingly used for tasks that require close proximity to people, yet practitioners lack practical methods to tune motion limits based on measured impact risk. We present an end-to-end, open toolchain that converts benchtop impact tests into deployable safety governors for drones. First, we describe a compact and replicable impact rig and protocol for capturing force-time profiles across drone classes and contact surfaces. Second, we provide data-driven models that map pre-impact speed to impulse and contact duration, enabling direct computation of speed bounds for a target force limit. Third, we release scripts and a ROS2 node that enforce these bounds online and log compliance, with support for facility-specific policies. We validate the workflow on multiple commercial off-the-shelf quadrotors and representative indoor assets, demonstrating that the derived governors preserve task throughput while meeting force constraints specified by safety stakeholders. Our contribution is a practical bridge from measured impacts to runtime limits, with shareable datasets, code, and a repeatable process that teams can adopt to certify indoor MAV operations near humans.

- **Residual Reinforcement Learning for Waste-Container Lifting Using Large-Scale Cranes with Underactuated Tools**  
  Qi Li, Karsten Berns

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  This paper studies the container lifting phase of a waste-container recycling task in urban environments, performed by a hydraulic loader crane equipped with an underactuated discharge unit, and proposes a residual reinforcement learning (RRL) approach that combines a nominal Cartesian controller with a learned residual policy. All experiments are conducted in simulation, where the task is characterized by tight geometric tolerances between the discharge-unit hooks and the container rings relative to the overall crane scale, making precise trajectory tracking and swing suppression essential. The nominal controller uses admittance control for trajectory tracking and pendulum-aware swing damping, followed by damped least-squares inverse kinematics with a nullspace posture term to generate joint velocity commands. A PPO-trained residual policy in Isaac Lab compensates for unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations, improving precision and robustness without requiring end-to-end learning from scratch. We further employ randomized episode initialization and domain randomization over payload properties, actuator gains, and passive joint parameters to enhance generalization. Simulation results demonstrate improved tracking accuracy, reduced oscillations, and higher lifting success rates compared to the nominal controller alone.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.

  The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.
